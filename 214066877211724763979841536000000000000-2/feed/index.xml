					<description><![CDATA[@Dominik, thanks!This is exactly what I hoped someone would come up with. In all the examples I&#039;ve computed with the Delta and Omega dessins, it is exactly the order of Mon(f)^d*Mon(g). Any reason why these dessins fit under &quot;most&quot; cases in which this has to be the whole wreath product?

@Jason,  no i didn&#039;t contact Wood, nor did i contact Manin or Marcolli about their paper. Given these are blogposts, they are more than welcome to help me (and readers of this blog who are interested in these papers) in my/our stumblings trying to get through their papers by leaving a reply (as is, of course, anyone else).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The monodromy group of the composition g°f is always a subgroup of the wreath product Mon(f)≀Mon(g). This wreath product has order Mon(f)^d * Mon(g) where d is the degree of g.
In &quot;most&quot; cases it will be the whole wreath product but there are cases when it is not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love your blog (read every new post).  Did you contact Melanie Wood about this?  I have made mistakes in papers, and I was always eager to hear from the people who caught the mistakes (usually also the best people to help me correct those mistakes).]]></description>
