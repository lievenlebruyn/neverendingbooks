					<description><![CDATA[My bad, thought there was a new post and got excited!  It was  the what about Simone Weil paper I’d already read.  Not sure I can get notified of posts or how to but will check back on occasion.  Not even quite sure how I stumbled here in the first place but happy to have done so.  Hopefully you still have some more insight forthcoming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your TØP theories are incredible and very helpful right now, I can’t wait to hear what else you come up with! I linked your blog to a group of clique conspiracy theorists so I apologize if they bombard you with questions once they realize the impressive resources you offer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greetings!  I just came across your blog --- thanks for all the interesting posts!

(1) I have not been able to find part two of this post on Witt vectors.  Is it been posted under a different name?

(2) I have not been able see any comments, on this post or others.  I have tried both firefox and the chrome browser.

THANKS!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I&#039;m not sure if you have these left, but I would love Ireland and Rosen if you still have it. Do you have a copy of Neukirch&#039;s Algebraic Number Theory? I can&#039;t see the titles very well. If so, I would also love that. If you can see my email here I can give you the address.]]></description>
