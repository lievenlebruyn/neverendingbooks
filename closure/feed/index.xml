					<description><![CDATA[@Theoreticalminimum Thanks! No worries, I&#039;ll still be digging up new Bourbaki-stories, but probably turn them into clips rather than posts (the TØP/Bourbaki posts would have been more enticing in a video format).
Another longer term project is to write a Bourbaki Travel Guide, or rather two: one part for Paris B-related stuff, the other for Bourbaki places in the &#039;province&#039;.
If either of these materialises in the coming months I&#039;ll post about it here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How sad! Thank you so so much for sharing all the things you&#039;ve shared over the years. I&#039;ve been following your blog for quite a bit of time, and I&#039;ve seen the many shapes it&#039;s taken throughout the years. You&#039;ve been my main source of Bourbaki and Grothendieck stories, and last year I discovered Twenty One Pilots thanks to you, which was one of the year&#039;s highlights for me.
Many thanks again, have a wonderful retirement, and keep well.]]></description>
