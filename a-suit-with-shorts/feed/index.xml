					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I&#039;m not sure if you have these left, but I would love Ireland and Rosen if you still have it. Do you have a copy of Neukirch&#039;s Algebraic Number Theory? I can&#039;t see the titles very well. If so, I would also love that. If you can see my email here I can give you the address.]]></description>
