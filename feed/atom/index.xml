					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/vialism-versus-weilism/"><![CDATA[<p>Testing the static update&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">21 pilots</a> themselves define Vialism, the &#8216;religion&#8217; of Dema, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozlHHR_eSxc">&#8216;I am Clancy&#8217;</a> video:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Their authority comes from two things: a miraculous power and a hijacked religion. One feeds the other. A cycle. It&#8217;s called <strong>Vialism</strong>, and all you really need to know is that it teaches that self-destruction is the only way to paradise.
</p></blockquote>

</center></p>
<p>Some people think that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/1bq1jme/we_figured_out_vialism_its_weilism/">Vialism means Weilism</a>, after the Weil siblings Andre and Simone.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a> (1909-1943) was a French philosopher and political activist. In her later years she became increasingly religious and inclined towards mysticism.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a> (1906-1998) was a French mathematician and founding member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Bourbaki group</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://s1.elespanol.com/2023/10/27/el-cultural/ciencia/entre_2_aguas/805179590_237138548_1024x576.jpg" width=100% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>They enter the lore via a picture on Tyler Joseph&#8217;s desktop in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4CLo1gpHyQ">Zane Lowe interview in 2018</a>, which is an overlay of two photographs of Bourbaki meetings in 1937 and 1938 featuring Andre and Simone.</p>
<p>For Simone this is the crucial period in her conversion to Catholicism, for Andre these meetings led to a reformulation of the foundations of TOPology, and discussions on Bourbaki&#8217;s version of Set theory which would lead to Bourbaki&#8217;s first book, published in 1939.</p>
<p>Both topics left a lasting impression on Simone Weil, as she wrote in 1942:</p>
<blockquote><p>
One field of mathematics that deals with all the diverse sorts of orders (set theory and general topology) is a treasure-house that holds an infinity of valuable expressions that show supernatural truth.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Simone was fairly generous in her use of the adjective &#8216;supernatural&#8217;. Here&#8217;s another quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“The supernatural greatness of Christianity lies in the fact that it does not seek a supernatural remedy for suffering but a supernatural use for it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This suggests that if Vialism really is Weilism, then the &#8216;miraculous power&#8217; might be mathematics (or at least the topics of set theory and topology), and the &#8216;hijacked religion&#8217; might be the (ab)use of mathematics in theology.</strong></p>
<p>Roughly speaking, axiomatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory</a> gives a precise list of instructions to construct all sets out of two given sets, the empty set $\emptyset$ (the set containing nothing) being one of them.</p>
<p>Emptiness, or the void, is important in Simone Weil&#8217;s theology, see for example her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Void-Spiritual-Backpack-Classics/dp/0874868300">Love in the void: where God finds us</a></p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+l4Snw9WL._SL1500_.jpg" width=50% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>or consider this quote by her:</p>
<blockquote><p>
God stripped himself of his godhood and became empty, and fulfilled us with false godhood. Let us strip off this false godhood and become empty. This very act is the ultimate purpose to creating us.
</p></blockquote>
<p>which sounds a lot like Vialism, becoming an &#8217;empty vessel&#8217; for the Bishops (or God) to fill.</p>
<p>Also in 21 pilots&#8217; iconography, the empty set $\emptyset$ is important.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://towardsthemorningson.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/large.jpg" width=100% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>Btw. the symbol $\emptyset$ for the empty set was first used by Andre Weil who remembered the Norwegian &#8216;eu&#8217; from his studies of nordic languages preparing for his &#8216;Finnish fugue&#8217; in 1939.</p>
<p>The other pre-given set challenges the Gods and theology. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity">Axiom of Infinity</a> in the Zermelo-Fraenkel system asserts the existence of an infinite set, usually denoted $\omega$ and interpreted as the set of all finite numbers $\{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,\dots \}$.</p>
<p>In other words, mathematical set theory contains an object which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_infinity">actual infinity</a>!</p>
<p>From the ancient Greeks on to early modern times, philosophers adhered to the motto &#8220;Infinitum actu non datur&#8221;, there is only a <em>potential infinity</em> (the idea of infinity) but <em>actual infinity</em> belongs to the realm of the Gods (infinite power, infinite wisdom,&#8230;).</p>
<p>As if this was not heretic enough, in comes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/sysTL8PHIUfMuuRpjC_WsilSCPvbL5BupQau1-jevMtts2AElShoojvnYVMmJfiXvmjtxwDiWvRuNoRfbOAspQhtBtI" width=100%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Georg Cantor (1845-1918) might very well be another Clancy.</p>
<p>He was a German mathematician, discoverer of the secrets of infinity, which brought him in conflict with several influential mathematicians in his time (notably Kronecker and Poincare), and inventor of <em>Cardinal</em> numbers (compare Bishops).</p>
<p>He suffered from depression and mental illness, was often admitted to the Halle nerve clinic. In between he was a founding member of the DEutscher MAthematiker Vereinigung (DeMa) of which he was the first president (Nico), he suffered from malnourishment during WW1 (compare Simone Weil in WW2) and died of a heart attack in the sanatorium where he had spent the last year of his life.</p>
<p>Cantor showed that the only distinguishing feature between two sets is their <em>Cardinality</em> (Bishopy power), roughly speaking the number of things they contain. He then showed that for every set of a certain Bishopy power, there&#8217;s one of even higher power!</p>
<p>For example, there exists a set with higher cardinality than $\omega$, that is, a set we cannot enumerate. An example is described in these lines from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_(song)">Morph</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Lights they blink to me, transmitting things to me<br />
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony<br />
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes<br />
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re talking about all possible infinite series of $0$&#8217;s and $1$&#8217;s and one quickly proves that these cannot be enumerated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument">Cantor&#8217;s diagonal argument</a>.</p>
<p>When applied to theology this says that Gods cannot have any actual infinity power, for there&#8217;s always an entity posessing higher powers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Cantor resolved to God being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_infinite">&#8216;absolute infinity&#8217;</a>, the Bishopy power of the <em>class</em> of all cardinal numbers (emphasis only important for mathematicians).</p>
<p>Much more on the interplay between Cantor&#8217;s mathematical results on infinities and his theological writings can be found in the paper <a href="https://dev.kath.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mam/ph-th/downloads/tapp_a24_2014_absolute_friedman_2auf1.pdf">Absolute Infinity:  A Bridge Between Mathematics and Theology?</a> by Christian Tapp.</p>
<p>The compassionate God of Christianity has presented theologians for centuries with the following paradox: how can a God having infinite power suffer because humans suffer?</p>
<p>In comes TOPology and one of its founding fathers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Hausdorff">Felix Hausdorff</a>.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Felix Hausdorff (1868-1942) might very well be another Clancy.</p>
<p>He was a German mathematician who made substantial contributions to topology as well as set theory. For years he felt opposition because he was Jewish.</p>
<p>After the Kristallnacht in 1938 he tried to escape Nazi-Germany (DeMa) but couldn&#8217;t obtain a position in the US. On 26 January 1942, Felix Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, died by suicide, rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp.</p>
<p>He was also a philosopher and writer under the pseudonym Paul Mongré. In 1900 he wrote a book of poems, Ecstasy, of which the first poem is <a href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1711&#038;context=jhm">“Den Ungeflügelten” (To The Wingless Ones)</a>. Am I the only one to think immediately of <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-isle-of-flightless-birds-lyrics">The isle of the flightless birds</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway, as to how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a> of Weilism solves the contradiction of the suffering God of Christianity is explained in the paper <a href="https://jpars.org/online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RSJ-1-OCHIAI.pdf">The Theology of Simone Weil and the Topology of Andre Weil</a> by Ochiai Hitoshi, professor of &#8216;Mathematical Theology&#8217; at Doshisha University, Kyoto.</p>
<p>He has a follow-up post <a href="https://apeironcentre.org/incarnation-and-reincarnation/">Incarnation and Reincarnation</a> on the <a href="https://apeironcentre.org/">Apeiron Centre</a> (where he also has a post on the <a href="https://apeironcentre.org/theology-of-georg-cantor/">Theology of Georg Cantor</a>). Here&#8217;s a summary of his thesis:</p>
<blockquote><p>
God is Open<br />
Incarnation is Compactified God<br />
The soul is Open<br />
Reincarnation is Compactified Soul<br />
God and the Soul are Homeomorphic<br />
God is without Boundaries<br />
The soul is with Boundaries<br />
God and the Soul are not Diffeomorphic
</p></blockquote>
<p>This succinctly sums up Weilism for you.</p>
<p>I now understand why so many people in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">21 pilots sub-Reddit</a> thought at the beginning of the Trench-era that Bourbaki was a group of mathematicians trying to prove the existence of God.</p>
<p>In the paper <a href="https://jpars.org/online/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RSJ-1-OCHIAI.pdf">The Theology of Simone Weil and the Topology of Andre Weil</a> the next quote is falsely attributed to Bourbaki</p>
<blockquote><p>
God is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandroff_extension">Alexandroff compactification</a> of the universe.
</p></blockquote>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/what-about-simone-weil/"><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, a theory that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a> is the key to Dema-lore is getting a lot of traction.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/weilism1.jpeg" width=80%><br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/nickcidental/status/1788539204223246784">Image credit</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>In two words, this theory is based on the assumption that Vialism=Weilism and on textual similarities between the writings of Simone Weil and the lyrics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">21 pilots</a> and the <a href="http://dmaorg.info/found/15398642_14/clancy.html">Clancy letters</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KEONSEAST">Keons YouTube channel</a> explains this in great detail.</p>
<p>Until now, I thought that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a> was crucial to the story, and that Simone&#8217;s role was merely to have a boy/girl archetypical situation.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s this iconic photograph of them from 1922, taken weeks before Andre entered the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)">ENS</a>:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DU4BfakW4AE-JdO.jpg" width=80%><br />
</center></p>
<p>The same setting, boy on the left, girl to the right was used in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMAPyGoqQVw&#038;t=234s">Nico and the niners-video</a>, when they are young and in Dema</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/SimoneAndreWeil.jpg" width=80%><br />
</center></p>
<p>and when they are a quite a bit older, and in Trench, at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcvblM8-_o&#038;t=389s">Outside-video</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/SimoneAndreWeil2.jpg" width=80%><br />
</center></p>
<p>These scenes may support my theory that Dema was the ENS (both Andre and Simone studied there) as is explained in the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-dema">Where&#8217;s Bourbaki&#8217;s Dema?</a>, and when they were both a bit older, and at the Bourbaki meetings in Chancay and Dieulefit, that they were banditos operating in Trench, as explained in the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-bishops-or-banditos">Bourbaki = Bishops or Banditos</a>.</p>
<p>There are two excellent books to read if you want to know more about the complex relationship between Andre and Simone Weil.</p>
<p>The first one is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weil-Conjectures-Math-Pursuit/dp/0374287619">The Weil Conjectures: On Math and the Pursuit of the Unknown</a> by Karen Olsson.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>From it we get the impression that, at times, Simone felt intellectually inferior to Andre, who was three years older. She often asked him to explain what he was working on. Famous is his letter to her written in 1940 when he was jailed. Here&#8217;s a nice Quanta-article on it, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-rosetta-stone-for-mathematics-20240506/">A Rosetta stone for mathematics</a>. This was also the reason why she wanted to attend some Bourbaki-meetings in order to get a better understanding of what mathematics was all about and how mathematicians think.</p>
<p>She was then very critical about mathematics because all that thinking about illusory objects had no immediate effect in real life. Well Simone, that&#8217;s the difference between mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<p>The second one is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chez-Weil-Andr%C3%A9-Simone-Sylvie/dp/2283023696/">Chez les Weil, Andre et Simone</a> written by Andre&#8217;s eldest daughter Sylvie.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zj2NZ2CaS._SL1000_.jpg" width=60%><br />
</center></p>
<p>From it we get another impression, namely that Andre may have been burdened by the fact that, after Simone&#8217;s death, his parents life centered exclusively around the preservation of her legacy, ignorant of the fact that their remaining child was one of the best mathematicians of his generation.</p>
<p>Poor Andre, on their family apartment in the Rue Auguste-Comte (which Andre used until late in his life when he was in Paris) is now this commemorative plaque</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/AugusteComte.jpg" width=100%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Well Andre, that&#8217;s the difference between a mathematician and a philosopher.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s return to the role Simone Weil may play in Dema-lore. For starters, how did she appear in it?</p>
<p>She makes her appearance through a picture on Tyler&#8217;s desktop at the start of the Trench-era. This picture is a combination of two photographs from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Bourbaki</a> meetings, and Simone Weil features in both of them.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/superimposed.jpg" width=100%><br />
</center></p>
<p>The photograph on the left is from the september 1937 meeting in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-escorial">Chancay</a>, that on the right is from the september 1938 meeting in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-and-the-miracle-of-silence">Dieulefit</a>.</p>
<p>These are exactly the years crucial in Simone&#8217;s conversion to catholicism.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1937 she experienced a religious ecstasy in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_Basilica_of_Saint_Mary_of_the_Angels_in_Assisi">Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Assisi</a>.</p>
<p>Over Easter is 1938, Simone and her mother attended Holy Week services at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solesmes_Abbey">Solesmes Abbey</a> where she had a mystic experience in which &#8220;Christ himself came down and took possession of me&#8221;.</p>
<p>One might ask whether there&#8217;s any connection between these religious experiences and her desire to attend these upcoming Bourbaki meetings. So, what was discussed during these conferences?</p>
<p>Mathematically, the 1938 meeting was not very exciting. Hardly any work was done, as they were preoccupied with all news of the Nazis invading Czechoslovakia. During the conference, Simone and Alain even escaped to Switzerland because they were convinced war was imminent. After a couple of days the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement">Munich Treaty</a> was signed, and Alain returned to Dieulefit, whereas Simone stayed in Switzerland, before returning to Paris.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Chancay meeting was revolutionary as the foundations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a> were rewritten there with the introduction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(mathematics)#:~:text=Any%20point%20x%20in%20the,such%20that%20N%20%E2%8A%86%20S.">filter</a> concept, dreamed up on the spot by Henri Cartan (the guy in the deckchair), while the others were taking a walk.</p>

<p>Simone was pretty impressed by the power of TOPology. In 1942 she wrote in her &#8216;Cahiers&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
One field of mathematics that deals with all the diverse sorts of orders (set theory and general topology) is a treasure-house that holds an infinity of valuable expressions that show supernatural truth.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, she mentions the two math-subjects closest to the pilots&#8217; universe: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set theory</a> studies all objects you can make starting from the empty set $\emptyset$, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology">topology</a> studies the properties of objects and figures that remain unchanged even when you<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_(song)">morph</a> them.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to say more about this in a next post when we look into the Vialism=Weilism assumption.</p>
<p>Another appearance of Simone Weil in the lore might be through the cropped image you can find on the dmaorg-website.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>The consensus opinion is that this is a picture of the young Clancy, next to one of the Bishops (Keons? Andre? Nico?).</p>
<p>In fact, the &#8216;little boy&#8217; is actually a girl and her identity is unresolved as far as I know. But, given the date of the photograph (1956) the girl might be (mistakingly) taken for Andre&#8217;s daughter Sylvie.</p>
<p>Now, almost everyone, in particular her grandparents and Andre himself, found that Sylvie was a spitting image (almost a &#8216;copy&#8217;) of Simone Weil.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>There are further indications that Simone Weil might be a Clancy.</p>
<p><strong>Morph</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morph_(song)">Morph</a> there are these lines</p>
<blockquote><p>
He&#8217;ll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki<br />
He&#8217;s got no friends close, but those who know him most know<br />
He goes by Nico<br />
He told me I&#8217;m a copy<br />
When I&#8217;d hear him mock me, that&#8217;s almost stopped me
</p></blockquote>
<p>During the meetings she attended, the other Bourbakis mocked Simone that she was a copy of het brother. From Karen Olsson&#8217;s book mentioned above:</p>
<blockquote><p>
To the others it&#8217;s startling to see his same glasses, his same face attached to this body clothed in an. unstylish dress and an off-kilter brown beret, carrying on in that odd monotone as she argues, via the chateau&#8217;s telephone, with the editors who publish her political articles.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Early in her career, Simone Weil was far from an original thinker. For her end-essay on Descartes she got the lowest score possible in order to pass from the ENS. Even Andre urged her to have a work-plan to develop her own ideas, rather than copying ideas from philosophers from the past.</p>
<p><strong>Jumpsuit</strong></p>
<p>Whereas Andre tried everything to avoid the draft, Simone was more of a warrior. In 1935 she volunteered to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish civil war, until a kitchen accident forced her to return to France.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Later in 1943 she left New-York to return to England and enlist in the French troupes of General de Gaulle, hoping to be <strong>parachuted</strong> behind enemy lines. Given her physical state, the military command decided against it. Upset by this refusal, she felt she had no other option than to deny herself food in empathy with the starving French.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t succeed in crossing Paladin Strait, sorry the Channel.</p>

<p>Can this be Simone Weil?</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/clancy-and-nancago/"><![CDATA[<p>Later this month, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">21 pilots</a>&#8216; next album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clancy_(album)">&#8220;Clancy&#8221;</a>, will be released, promising to give definite answers to all remaining open questions in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/1cfi97t/official_twenty_one_pilots_clancy_lore_megathread/">Dema-lore</a>.</p>
<p>By then we will have been told why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Bourbaki group</a> show up in the Trench/Dema tale.</p>
<p>This leaves me a couple of weeks to pursue this series of posts (see links below) in which I try to find the best match possible between the factual history of the Bourbaki group and elements from the Dema-storyline.</p>
<p>Two well-known Bourbaki-photographs seem important to the pilots. The first one is from the september 1938 Dieulefit/Beauvallon Bourbaki congress:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bourbaki_congress1938.png/440px-Bourbaki_congress1938.png" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>At the time, Bourbaki still had to publish their first text, they were rebelling against the powers that be in French mathematics, and were just kicked out of the Julia seminar.</p>
<p>In clikkies parlance: at that moment the Bourbakistas are Banditos, operating in Trench.</p>
<p>The second photograph, below on the left, is part of a famous picture of Andre Weil, supposedly taken in the summer of 1956.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Se_elf.jpg" width=55%> <img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Weil.jpg" width=40%><br />
</center></p>
<p>At that time, Bourbaki was at its peak of influence over French mathematics, suffocating enthusiastic math-students with their dry doctrinal courses, and forcing other math-subjects (group theory, logic, applied math, etc.) to a virtual standstill.</p>
<p>In clique-speech: at that moment the Bourbakistas are Bishops, ruling Dema.</p>
<p>Let me recall the story of one word, associated to the Bourbaki=Bishops era which lasted roughly twenty years, from the early 50ties till Bourbaki&#8217;s &#8216;death&#8217; in 1968 : <strong>Nancago</strong>.</p>
<p>From the 50ties, Nicolas Bourbaki signed the prefaces of &#8216;his&#8217; books from the University of Nancago.</p>
<p>Between 1951 and 1975, Weil and Diedonne directed a series of texts, published by Hermann, under the heading &#8220;Publications de l’Institut mathematique de l’Universite de Nancago&#8221;.</p>
<p>Bourbaki&#8217;s death announcement mentioned that he &#8220;piously passed away on November 11, 1968  at his home in Nancago&#8221;.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/nancago1.jpg" width=100% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>Nancago was the name of a villa, owned by Dieudonne, near Nice. Etc. etc.</p>
<p>But then, what is <strong>Nancago</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, NANCAGO is a tale of two cities: NANcy and ChiCAGO.</p>
<p>The French city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy,_France">Nancy</a> because from the very first Bourbaki meetings, the secretarial headquarters of Bourbaki, led by Jean Delsarte, was housed in the mathematical Institute in Nancy.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://cdn-s-www.estrepublicain.fr/images/0947EBD8-54B8-4ED4-A804-8B1EF3DCC251/NW_detail/l-institut-de-mathematiques-et-l-institut-de-physique-de-l-universite-de-nancy-au-temps-de-delsarte-1595324341.jpg" width=100%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Chicago because that&#8217;s where Andre Weil was based after WW2 until 1958 when he moved to Princeton.</p>
<p>Much more on the history of Nancago can be found in the newspaper article by Bourbaki scholar par excellance Liliane Beaulieu: <a href="https://www.estrepublicain.fr/education/2011/06/15/quand-nancy-s-appelait-nancago">Quand Nancy s&#8217;appelait Nancago</a> (When Nancy was called Nancago).</p>
<p>Right, but then, if Nancago is the codeword of the Bourbaki=Bishops era, what would be the corresponding codeword for the Bourbaki=Banditos era?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, from 1935 till 1968 Bourbaki&#8217;s headquarters was based in Nancy, so even in 1938  Nancy should be one of the two cities mentioned. But what is the other one?</p>
<p>In 1938, Bourbaki&#8217;s founding members were scattered over several places, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Delsarte">Jean Delsarte</a> and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonne</a> in Nancy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szolem_Mandelbrojt">Szolem Mandelbrojt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_de_Possel">Rene de Possel</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clermont-Ferrand">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, and Andre Weil and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a> was on a research stay in Princeton.</p>
<p>Remember the Bourbaki photograph at the Beauvallon meeting above? Well, it was taken in september 1938 when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> was reached.</p>
<p>Why is this relevent? Well, because Strasbourg was too close to the German border, right after the Munich agreement the Strasbourg Institute was ordered to withdraw to the University of Clermont-Ferrand.</p>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand lies a bit south of Vichy and remained in WW2 in the &#8216;free zone&#8217; of France, whereas Strasbourg was immediately annexed by Germany.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/files/original/france-occupee-1940-1942.jpg" width=80%><br />
</center></p>
<p>For more on the importance of Clermont-Ferrand for Bourbaki during 1940-1942 see the article by Christophe Eckes and Gatien Ricotier <a href="https://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/congres-clermont-ferrand-1940-1941-1942">Les congrès de Clermont-Ferrand de 1940, 1941 et 1942</a>.</p>
<p>That is, all Bourbaki members where then either affiliated to Nancy or to Clermont-Ferrand.</p>
<p>A catchy codeword for the Bourbaki=Banditos era, similar to Nancago as the tale of two cities, might then be:</p>
<p><strong>CL</strong>ermont-Ferrand + n<strong>ANCY</strong> = <strong>CLANCY</strong>.</p>
<p>[For clikkies: rest assured, I&#8217;m well aware of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/1ce78im/did_everyone_forget_the_origin_of_the_name_clancy/">consensus opinion on the origins of Clancy&#8217;s name</a>. But in this series of posts I&#8217;m not going for the consensus or even intended meanings, but rather for a joyful interplay between historical facts about the Bourbaki group and elements from Dema-lore.]</p>

<p>Later this week new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> material is expected, so this might be a good time to add some remarks to a series of posts I ran last summer, trying to find a connection between <a href="https://twentyonepilots.fandom.com/wiki/Dmaorg.info">Dema-lore</a> and the actual history of the Bourbaki group. Here are links to these posts:</p>

<p>In the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/9-bourbaki-founding-members-really">&#8220;9 Bourbaki founding members, really?&#8221;</a> I questioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki#:~:text=Nicolas%20Bourbaki%20(French%3A%20%5Bnik%C9%94la,a%">Wikipedia&#8217;s assertion</a> that there were exactly nine founding members of Nicolas Bourbaki:</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I still stand by the arguments given in that post, but my opinion on this is completely irrelevant. What matters is who the Bourbaki-gang themself deemed worthy to attach their names to their first publication &#8216;Theorie des Ensembles&#8217; (1939).</p>
<p>But wait, wasn&#8217;t the whole point of choosing the name Nicolas Bourbaki for their collective that the actual authors of the books should remain anonymous?</p>
<p>Right, but then I found this strange document in the <a href="http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/">Bourbaki Archives</a> : <a href="http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/consulter.php?id=awms_001">awms_001</a>, a preliminary version of the first two chapters of &#8216;Theorie des Ensembles&#8217; written by Andre Weil and annotated by Rene de Possel. Here&#8217;s the title page:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/TitlePageTdE.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>Next to N. Bourbaki we see nine capital letters: M.D.D.D.E.C.C.C.W corresponding to nine AW-approved founding members of Bourbaki: Mandelbrojt, Delsarte, De Possel, Dieudonne, Ehresmann, Chevalley, Coulomb, Cartan and Weil!</p>
<p>What may freak out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/?f=flair_name%3A%22Theory%22">Clique</a> is the similarity between the diagram to the left of the title, and the canonical depiction of the nine Bishops of Dema (at the center of the map of Dema) or the cover of the Blurryface album:</p>

<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Bishops9.png" width=95%><br />

<p>In <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/top-photoshop-mysteries">the Photoshop mysteries post</a> I explained why Mandelbrojt and Weil might have been drawn in opposition to each other, but I am unaware of a similar conflict between either of the three C&#8217;s (Cartan, Coulomb and Chevalley) and the three D&#8217;s (Delsarte, De Possel and Dieudonne).</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ll have to leave the identification of the nine Bourbaki founding members with the nine Dema Bishops as a riddle for another post.</p>
<p>The second remark concerns the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-dema">Where’s Bourbaki’s Dema?</a>.</p>
<p>In that post I briefly suggested that DEMA might stand for DEutscher MAthematiker (German Mathematicians), and hinted at the group of people around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Artin">Emil Artin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether">Emmy Noether</a>, but discarded this as &#8220;one can hardly argue that there was a self-destructive attitude (like Vialism) present among that group, quite the opposite&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn&#8217;t know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Mathematik">Deutsche Mathematik</a>, a mathematics journal founded in 1936 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Bieberbach">Ludwig Bieberbach</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Vahlen">Theodor Vahlen</a>.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Deutsche Mathematik is also the name of a movement closely associated with the journal whose aim was to promote &#8220;German mathematics&#8221; and eliminate &#8220;Jewish influence&#8221; in mathematics. More about Deutsche Mathematik can be found on <a href="https://www5.in.tum.de/lehre/seminare/math_nszeit/SS03/vortraege/de-math/">this page</a>, where these eight mathematicians are mentioned in connection with it:</p>

<p>Perhaps one can add to this list:</p>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Witt">Ernst Witt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether DEutsche MAthematik stands for DEMA, and which of these German mathematicians were its nine bishops might be the topic of another post. First I&#8217;ll have to read through Sanford Segal&#8217;s <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691164632/mathematicians-under-the-nazis">Mathematicians under the Nazis</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Added February 29th:</strong></p>
<p>The long awaited new song has now surfaced:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/53tgVlXBZVg?si=UwaRjXUafwTKLgBI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only watched it once, but couldn&#8217;t miss the line &#8220;I fly by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbaki_dangerous_bend_symbol">dangerous bend symbol</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t we all fly by them in our first readings of Bourbaki&#8230;</p>
<p>(Fortunately the clique already <a href="https://twitter.com/DiscordClique/status/1763270261623648562">spotted that reference</a>).</p>
<p>No intention to freak out clikkies any further, but in the aforementioned Weil draft of &#8216;Theorie des Ensembles&#8217; they still used this precursor to the dangerous bend symbol</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/closure/"><![CDATA[<p>Exactly 20 years ago I wrote my first blogpost, <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/a-blogging-2004">&#8216;a blogging 2004&#8217;</a>. I wasn&#8217;t using WordPress yet (but something called pMachine), and this blog was not called &#8216;neverendingbooks&#8217;, but &#8216;lievenlb.local&#8217; (the URL of the mac still running this blog).</p>
<p>At the time I wanted to find out whether blogging was something for me. &#8220;I’m just starting out. Give me a couple of weeks/months to develop my own style and topics and I’ll change the layout accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, after 20 years I know what I can, and more important, what I cannot do within this framework. Time to move on.</p>
<p>There are other reasons why this might be the right time to pull the plug.</p>
<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m on retirement since October 1st and soon I&#8217;ll have to vacate my office, containing the webserver on which NeB runs.</p>
<p>&#8211; My days are filled with more activities now, and I don&#8217;t think you want to read here for example about my struggles with chestnut-farming.</p>
<p>&#8211; I like to explore other channels to talk about mathematics. This may happen on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@lievenlebruyn/with_replies">Mathstodon</a>, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/users/2275/lieven-lebruyn">MathOverflow</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoO-GhK4TUFhFDenILglrhg">YouTube</a>. Or it might be through teaching or writing a book, perhaps even a children&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>NeB will remain reachable until mid 2024. I&#8217;ll check out options to preserve its content after that (suggestions are welcome).</p>
<p>I wish you a better 2024.</p>

</ul>
<p>So, what&#8217;s new?</p>
<p>Well, finally we have closure!</p>
<p>Last Friday, Grothendieck&#8217;s children donated the 30.000 Laserre pages to the <a href="https://www.bnf.fr/fr">Bibliotheque Nationale de France</a>.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.rtbf.be/article/des-manuscrits-inedits-du-genie-des-maths-grothendieck-entrent-a-la-bnf-11264549">Des manuscrits inédits du génie des maths Grothendieck entrent à la BnF</a> (and Google-translate):</p>
<p>&#8220;The singularity of these manuscripts is that they &#8220;cover many areas at the same time&#8221; to form &#8220;a whole, a + cathedral work +, with undeniable literary qualities&#8221;, analyzes Jocelyn Monchamp, curator in the manuscripts department of the BnF.</p>
<p>More than in “Récoltes et semailles”, very autobiographical, the author is “in a metaphysical retreat”, explains the curator, who has been going through the texts with passion for a month. A long-term task as the writing, in fountain pen, is dense and difficult to decipher. “I got used to it… And the advantage for us was that the author had methodically paginated and dated the texts.” One of the parts, entitled &#8220;Structures of the psyche&#8221;, a book of enigmatic diagrams translating psychology into algebraic language. In another, &#8220;The Problem of Evil&#8221;, he unfolds over 15,000 pages metaphysical meditations and thoughts on Satan. We sense a man &#8220;caught up by the ghosts of his past&#8221;, with an adolescence marked by the Shoah, underlines Johanna Grothendieck whose grandfather, a Russian Jew who fled Germany during the war, died at Auschwitz.</p>
<p>The deciphering work will take a long time to understand everything this genius wanted to say.</p>
<p>On Friday, the collection joined the manuscripts department of the Richelieu site, the historic cradle of the BnF, alongside the writings of Pierre and Marie Curie and Louis Pasteur. It will only be viewable by researchers.“This is a unique testimony in the history of science in the 20th century, of major importance for research,” believes Jocelyn Monchamp.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, one of the volumes was placed in a glass case next to a manuscript by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably, the recent publication of <a href="https://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Tel/Recoltes-et-Semailles-I-II">Récoltes et Semailles</a> clinched the deal.</p>
<p>Also, it is unclear at this moment whether the <a href="https://igrothendieck.org/en/">Istituto Grothendieck</a>, which harbours <a href="https://igrothendieck.org/en/centre-for-grothendiecian-studies/">The centre for Grothendieck studies</a> coordinated by Mateo Carmona (see <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/grothendiecks-gribouillis-5">this post</a>) played a role in the decision making, nor what role the Centre will play in the further studies of Grothendieck&#8217;s gribouillis.</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/a-question-of-loyalty/"><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-strange-island-of-two-truths">island of two truths</a>, statements are either false (truth-value $0$), Q-true (value $Q$) or K-true (value $K$).</p>
<p>The King and Queen of the island have an opinion on all statements which may differ from their actual truth-value. We say that the Queen <em>believes</em> a statement $p$ is she assigns value $Q$ to it, and that she <em>knows</em> $p$ is she believes $p$ and the actual truth-value of $p$ is indeed $Q$. Similarly for the King, replacing $Q$&#8217;s by $K$&#8217;s.</p>
<p>All other inhabitants of the island are <em>loyal</em> to the Queen, or to the King, or to both. This means that they <em>agree</em> with the Queen (or King, or both) on all statements they have an opinion on. Two inhabitants are said to be <em>loyal</em> to each other if they agree on all statements they both have an opinion of.</p>
<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-strange-island-of-two-truths">Last time</a> we saw that Queen and King agree on all statements one of them believes to be false, as well as the negation of such statements. This raised the question:</p>
<p><em>Are the King and Queen loyal to each other? That is, do Queen and King agree on all statements?</em></p>
<p>We cannot resolve this issue without the information Oscar was able to extract from Pointex in <a href="https://we.vub.ac.be/en/karin-cvetko-vah">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a>&#8216;s post <a href="https://mathsandbeyond.blogspot.com/2020/06/pointex.html">Pointex</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oscar was determined to get some more information. &#8220;Could you at least tell me whether the queen and the king know that they&#8217;re loyal to themselves?&#8221; he asked.<br />
&#8220;Well, of course they know that!&#8221; replied Pointex.<br />
&#8220;You said that a proposition can be Q-TRUE, K-TRUE or FALSE,&#8221; Oscar said.<br />
&#8220;Yes, of course. What else!&#8221; replied Pointex as he threw the cap high up.<br />
&#8220;Well, you also said that each native was loyal either to the queen or to the king. I was just wondering &#8230; Assume that A is loyal to the queen. Then what is the truth value of the statement: A is loyal to the queen?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Q, of course,&#8221; answered Pointex as he threw the cap up again.<br />
&#8220;And what if A is not loyal to the queen? What is then the truth value of the statement: A is loyal to the queen?&#8221;<br />
He barely finished his question as something fell over his face and covered his eyes. It was the funny cap.<br />
&#8220;Thanx,&#8221; said Pointex as Oscar handed him the cap. &#8220;The value is 0, of course.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Can the truth value of the statement: &#8216;A is loyal to the queen&#8217; be K in any case?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Well, what do you think? Of course not! What a ridiculous thing to ask!&#8221; replied Pointex.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Puzzle</strong> : Show that Queen and King are <em>not</em> loyal to each other, that is, there are statements on which they do not agree.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/loyalty.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> : &#8216;The King is loyal to the Queen&#8217; must have actual truth-value $0$ or $Q$, and the sentence &#8216;The Queen is loyal to the King&#8217; must have actual truth-value $0$ or $K$. But both these sentences are the same as the sentence &#8216;The Queen and King are loyal to each other&#8217; and as this sentence can have only one truth-value, it must have value $0$ so the statement is false.</p>
<p>Note that we didn&#8217;t produce a specific statement on which the Queen and King disagree. Can you find one?</p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-strange-island-of-two-truths/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/some-skew-smullyan-stumpers">Last time</a> we had a brief encounter with the island of two truths, invented by <a href="https://we.vub.ac.be/en/karin-cvetko-vah">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a>. See her posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mathsandbeyond.blogspot.com/2020/06/oscar-on-island-of-two-truths.html">Oscar on the island of two truths</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mathsandbeyond.blogspot.com/2020/06/pointex.html">Pointex</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On this island, false statements have truth-value $0$ (as usual), but non-false statements are not necessarily true,  but can be given either truth-value $Q$ (statements which the Queen on the island prefers) or $K$ (preferred by the King).</p>
<p>Think of the island as Trump&#8217;s paradise where nobody is ever able to say: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts">&#8220;Look, alternative truths are not truths. They&#8217;re falsehoods.&#8221;</a></p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>Even the presence of just one &#8216;alternative truth&#8217; has dramatic consequences on the rationality of your reasoning. If we know the truth-values of specific sentences, we can determine the truth-value of more complex sentences in which we use logical connectives such as $\vee$ (or), $\wedge$ (and), $\neg$ (not), and $\implies$ (then) via these truth tables:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\downarrow~\bf{\wedge}~\rightarrow &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />

<p>Note that the truth-values $Q$ and $K$ are not completely on equal footing as we have to make a choice which one of them will stand for $\neg 0$.</p>
<p>Common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)">tautologies</a> are no longer valid on this island. The best we can have are $Q$-tautologies (giving value $Q$ whatever the values of the components) or $K$-tautologies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one $Q$-tautology (check!) : $(\neg p) \vee (\neg \neg p)$. Verify that $p \vee (\neg p)$ is neither a $Q$- nor a $K$-tautology.</p>
<p>Can you find any $K$-tautology at all?</p>
<p>Already this makes it incredibly difficult to adapt Smullyan-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves">Knights and Knaves</a> puzzles to this skewed island. <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/some-skew-smullyan-stumpers">Last time</a> I gave one easy example.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/2island2.png" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle</strong> : On an island of two truths all inhabitants are either Knaves (saying only false statements), Q-Knights (saying only $Q$-valued statements) or K-Knights (who only say $K$-valued statements).</p>
<p>The King came across three inhabitants, whom we will call $A$, $B$ and $C$. He asked $A$: &#8220;Are you one of my  Knights?&#8221; $A$ answered, but so indistinctly that the King could not understand what he said.</p>
<p>He then asked $B$: &#8220;What did he say?&#8221; $B$ replies: &#8220;He said that he is a Knave.&#8221; At this point, $C$ piped up and said: &#8220;That&#8217;s not true!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was $C$ a Knave, a Q-Knight or a K-Knight?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> : Q- and K-Knights can never claim to be a Knave. Neither can Knaves because they can only say false statements. So, no inhabitant on the island can ever claim to be a Knave. So, $B$ lies and is a Knave, so his stament has truth-value $0$. $C$ claims the negation of what $B$ says so the truth-value of his statement is $\neg 0 = Q$. $C$ must be a Q-Knight.</p>
<p>As if this were not difficult enough, Karin likes to complicate things by letting the Queen and King assign their own truth-values to all sentences, which may coincide with their actual truth-value or not.</p>
<p>Clearly, these two truth-assignments follow the logic of the island of two truths for composed sentences, and we impose one additional rule: if the Queen assigns value $0$ to a statement, then so does the King, and vice versa.</p>
<p>I guess she wanted to set the stage for variations to the island of two truths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_modal_logic">epistemic modal logical</a> puzzles as in Smullyan&#8217;s book <a href="https://raymondsmullyan.com/books/forever-undecided/">Forever Undecided</a> (for a quick summary, have a look at Smullyan&#8217;s paper <a href="http://www.tark.org/proceedings/tark_mar19_86/p341-smullyan.pdf">Logicians who reason about themselves</a>).</p>
<p>A possible interpretation of the Queen&#8217;s truth-assignment is that she assigns value $Q$ to all statements she believes to be true, value $0$ to all statements she believes to be false, and value $K$ to all statements she has no fixed opinion on (she neither believes them to be true nor false). The King assigns value $K$ to all statements he believes to be true, $0$ to those he believes to be false, and $Q$ to those he has no fixed opinion on.</p>
<p>For example, if the Queen has no fixed opinion on $p$ (so she assigns value $K$ to it), then the King can either believe $p$ (if he also assigns value $K$ to it) or can have no fixed opinion on $p$ (if he assigns value $Q$ to it), but he can never believe $p$ to be false.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/2island3.png" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle</strong> : We say that Queen and King &#8216;agree&#8217; on a statement $p$ if they both assign the same value to it. So, they agree on all statements one of them (and hence both) believe to be false. But there&#8217;s more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show that Queen and King agree on the negation of all statements one of them believes to be false.</li>
<li>Show that the King never believes the negation of whatever statement.</li>
<li>Show that the Queen believes all negations of statements the King believes to be false.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> : If one of them believes $p$ to be false (s)he will assign value $0$ to $p$ (and so does the other), but then they both have to assign value $Q$ to $\neg p$, so they agree on this.</p>
<p>The value of $\neg p$ can never be $K$, so the King does not believe $\neg p$.</p>
<p>If the King believes $p$ to be false he assigns value $0$ to it, and so does the Queen, but then the value of $\neg p$ is $Q$ and so the Queen believes $\neg p$.</p>
<p>We see that the Queen and King agree on a lot of statements, they agree on all statements one of them believes to be false, and they agree on the negation of such statements!</p>
<p>Can you find any statement at all on which they do not agree?</p>
<p>Well, that may be a little bit premature. We didn&#8217;t say which sentences about the island are allowed, and what the connection (if any) is between the Queen and King&#8217;s value-assignments and the actual truth values.</p>
<p>For example, the Queen and King may agree on a classical ($0$ or $1$) truth-assignments to the atomic sentences for the island, and replace all $1$&#8217;s with $Q$. This will give a consistent assignment of truth-values, compatible with the island&#8217;s strange logic. (We cannot do the same trick replacing $1$&#8217;s by $K$ because $\neg 0 = Q$).</p>
<p>Clearly, such a system may have no relation at all with the intended meaning of these sentences on the island (the actual truth-values).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="https://we.vub.ac.be/en/karin-cvetko-vah">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a> introduced the notions of &#8216;loyalty&#8217; and &#8216;sanity&#8217; for inhabitants of the island. That&#8217;s for next time, and perhaps then you&#8217;ll be able to answer the question whether Queen and King agree on all statements.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan">Raymond Smullyan</a>&#8216;s logic puzzles are legendary. Among his best known are his Knights (who always tell the truth) and Knaves (who always lie) puzzles. Here&#8217;s a classic example.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the day of his arrival, the anthropologist Edgar Abercrombie came across three inhabitants, whom we will call $A$, $B$ and $C$. He asked $A$: &#8220;Are you a Knight or a Knave?&#8221; $A$ answered, but so indistinctly that Abercrombie could not understand what he said.</p>
<p>He then asked $B$: &#8220;What did he say?&#8221; $B$ replies: &#8220;He said that he is a knave.&#8221; At this point, $C$ piped up and said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t believe that; it&#8217;s a lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was $C$ a Knight or a Knave?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are stumped by this, try to figure out what kind of inhabitant can say &#8220;I am a Knave&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some years ago, my friend and co-author <a href="https://si.linkedin.com/in/karin-cvetko-vah-8430a350">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a> wrote about a much stranger island, <a href="https://mathsandbeyond.blogspot.com/2020/06/oscar-on-island-of-two-truths.html">the island of two truths</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The island was ruled by a queen and a king. It is important to stress that the queen was neither inferior nor superior to the king. Rather than as a married couple one should think of the queen and the king as two parallel powers, somewhat like the Queen of the Night and the King Sarastro in Mozart&#8217;s famous opera The Magic Flute. The queen and the king had their own castle each, each of them had their own court, their own advisers and servants, and most importantly each of them even had their own truth value.</p>
<p>On the island, a proposition p is either FALSE, Q-TRUE or K-TRUE; in each of the cases we say that p has value 0, Q or K, respectively. The queen finds the truth value Q to be superior, while the king values the most the value K. The queen and the king have their opinions on all issues, while other residents typically have their opinions on some issues but not all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The logic of the island of two truths is the easiest example of what Karin and I called a non-commutative frame or skew Heyting algebra (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04949">here</a>), a notion we then used, jointly with <a href="https://jenshemelaer.com/">Jens Hemelaer</a>, to define the notion of a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02831">non-commutative topos</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://elle.metropolitan.si/media/cache/upload/Photo/2014/10/22/s43_40_cvetko-vah-karin_fbimage.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>If you take our general definitions, and take Q as the distinguished top-element, then the truth tables for the island of two truths are these ones (value of first term on the left, that of the second on top):</p>
<p>\[<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\wedge &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
Q &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; Q \\<br />
K &#038; 0 &#038; K &#038; K<br />
\end{array} \quad<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\vee &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
Q &#038; Q &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
K &#038; K &#038; Q &#038; K<br />
\end{array} \quad<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\rightarrow &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; Q &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
Q &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
K &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K<br />
\end{array} \quad<br />
\begin{array}{c|c}<br />
 &#038; \neg  \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; Q \\<br />
Q &#038; 0 \\<br />
K &#038; 0<br />
\end{array}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Note that on this island the order of statements is important! That is, the truth value of $p \wedge q$ may differ from that of $q \wedge p$ (and similarly for $\vee$).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s reconsider Smullyan&#8217;s puzzle at the beginning of this post, but now on an island of two truths, where every inhabitant is either of Knave, or a Q-Knight (uttering only Q-valued statements), or a K-Knight (saying only K-valued statements).</p>
<p>Again, can you determine what type $C$ is?</p>
<p>Well, if you forget about the distinction between Q- and K-valued sentences, then we&#8217;re back to classical logic (or more generally, if you divide out Green&#8217;s equivalence relation from any skew Heyting algebra you obtain an ordinary Heyting algebra), and we have seen that then $B$ must be a Knave and $C$ a Knight, so in our new setting we know that $C$ is either a Q-Knight or a K-Knight, but which of the two?</p>
<p>Now, $C$ claims the negation of what $B$ said, so the truth value is $\neg 0 = Q$, and therefore $C$ must be a Q-Knight.</p>
<p>Recall that in <a href="https://si.linkedin.com/in/karin-cvetko-vah-8430a350">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a>&#8216;s island of two truths all sentences have a unique value which can be either $0$ (false) or one of the non-false values Q or K, and the value of combined statements is given by the truth tables above. The Queen and King both have an opinion on all statements, which may or may not coincide with the actual value of that statement. However, if the Queen assigns value $0$ to a statement, then so does the King, and conversely.</p>
<p>Other inhabitants of the island have only their opinion about a subset of all statements (which may be empty). Two inhabitants <em>agree</em> on a statement if they both have an opinion on it and assign the same value to it.</p>
<p>Now, each inhabitant is either <em>loyal</em> to the Queen or to the King (or both), meaning that they agree with the Queen (resp. King) on all statements they have an opinion of. An inhabitant loyal to the Queen is said to <em>believe</em> a sentence when she assigns value $Q$ to it (and symmetric for those loyal to the King), and <em>knows</em> the statement if she believes it and that value coincides with the actual value of that statement.</p>
<p>Further, if A is loyal to the Queen, then the value of the statement &#8216;A is loyal to the Queen&#8217; is Q, and if A is not loyal to the Queen, then the value of the sentence &#8216;A is loyal to the Queen&#8217; is $0$ (and similarly for statements about loyalty to the King).</p>
<p>These notions are enough for the first batch of ten puzzles in Karin&#8217;s posts</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mathsandbeyond.blogspot.com/2020/06/oscar-on-island-of-two-truths.html">Oscar on the island of two truths</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mathsandbeyond.blogspot.com/2020/06/pointex.html">Pointex</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just one example:</p>
<p>Show that if anybody on the island knows that A is not loyal to the Queen, then everybody that has an opinion about the sentence &#8216;A is loyal to the Queen&#8217; knows that.</p>
<p>After these two posts, Karin decided that it was more fun to blog about the use of non-commutative frames in data analysis.</p>
<p>But, she once gave me a text containing many more puzzles (as well as all the answers), so perhaps I&#8217;ll share these in a follow-up post.</p>

</ul>
<p>Clearly, if $q=p^k$ is a pure prime power, then the projective plane over $\mathbb{F}_q$, $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ (that is, all nonzero triples of elements from the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ up to simultaneous multiplication with a non-zero element from $\mathbb{F}_q$) is a projective plane of order $q$.</p>
<p>The easiest example being $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ consisting of seven points and lines</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/planeorder2.png" width=100%></p>
<p>But, there are others. A triangle is a projective plane of order $1$, which is not of the above form, unless you believe in the field with one element $\mathbb{F}_1$&#8230;</p>
<p>And, apart from $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_{3^2})$, there are three other, non-isomorphic, projective planes of order $9$.</p>
<p>It is clear then that for all $n < 10$, except perhaps $n=6$, a projective plane of order $n$ exists.

</p>
<p>In 1938, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Chandra_Bose">Raj Chandra Bose</a> showed that there is <strong>no</strong> plane of order $6$ as there cannot be $5$ mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $6$, when even the problem of two orthogonal squares of order $6$ (see <a href="http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-latinii1">Euler&#8217;s problem of the $36$ officers</a>) is impossible.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah Bob,  I know it has a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/eulers-243-year-old-impossible-puzzle-gets-a-quantum-solution-20220110/">quantum solution</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway by May 1977, when Lenstra&#8217;s Festschrift &#8216;Een pak met een korte broek&#8217; (<a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/a-suit-with-shorts">a suit with shorts</a>) was published, the existence of a projective plane of order $10$ was still wide open.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Odlyzko">Andrew Odlyzko</a> (probably known best for his numerical work on the Riemann zeta function) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Sloane">Neil Sloane</a> (probably best known as the creator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>) joined forces to publish in Lenstra&#8217;s festschrift a note claiming (jokingly) the existence of a projective plane of order ten, as they were able to find a finite field of ten elements.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a transcript:</p>
<p><strong>A PROJECTIVE PLAIN OF ORDER TEN</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. M. Odlyzko and N.J.A. Sloane</strong></p>
<p>This note settles in the affirmative the notorious question of the existence of a projective plain of order ten.</p>
<p>It is well-known that if a finite field $F$ is given containing $n$ elements, then the projective plain of order $n$ can be immediately constructed (see M. Hall Jr., Combinatorial Theory, Blaisdell, Waltham, Mass. 1967 and D.R. Hughes and F.C. Piper, Projective Planes, Springer-Verlag, N.Y., 1970).</p>
<p>For example, the points of the plane are represented by the nonzero triples $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ of elements of $F$, with the convention that $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $(r\alpha, r\beta, r\gamma)$ represent the same point, for all nonzero $r \in F$.</p>
<p>Furthermore this plain even has the desirable property that Desargues&#8217; theorem holds there.</p>
<p>What makes this note possible is our recent discovery of a field containing exactly ten elements: we call it the <strong>digital field</strong>.</p>
<p>We first show that this field exists, and then give a childishly simple construction which the reader can easily verify.</p>
<p><strong>The Existence Proof</strong></p>
<p>Since every real number can be written in the decimal system we conclude that</p>
<p>\[<br />
\mathbb{R} = GF(10^{\omega}) \]</p>
<p>Now $\omega = 1.\omega$, so $1$ divides $\omega$. Therefore by a standard theorem from field theory (e.g. B. L. van der Waerden, Modern Algebra, Ungar, N.Y., 1953, 2nd edition, Volume 1, p. 117) $\mathbb{R}$ contains a subfield $GF(10)$. This completes the proof.</p>
<p><strong>The Construction</strong></p>
<p>The elements of this digital field are shown in Fig. 1.</p>
<p>They are labelled $Left_1, Left_2, \dots, Left_5, Right_1, \dots, Right_5$ in the natural ordering (reading from left to right).</p>

<p>Addition is performed by counting, again in the natural way. An example is shown in Fig. 2, and for further details the reader can consult any kindergarten student.</p>
<p>In all digital systems the rules for multiplication can be written down immediately once addition has been defined; for example $2 \times n = n+n$. The reader will easily verify the rest of the details.</p>
<p>Since this field plainly contains ten elements (see Fig. 1) we conclude that there <strong>is</strong> a projective plain of order ten.</p>
<p>So far, the transcript.</p>
<p>More seriously now, the non-existence of a projective plane of order ten was only established in 1988, heavily depending on computer-calculations. A nice account is given in</p>

<p>Now that recent iPhones nearly have the computing powers of former Cray&#8217;s, one might hope for easier proofs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, such a proof now exists, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04715">A SAT-based Resolution of Lam&#8217;s Problem</a> by Curtis Bright, Kevin K. H. Cheung, Brett Stevens, Ilias Kotsireas, Vijay Ganesh</p>
<p>David Roberts, aka the HigherGeometer, did a nice post on this <a href="https://thehighergeometer.wordpress.com/2023/08/09/no-order-10-projective-planes-via-sat/"><br />
No order-10 projective planes via SAT</a>.</p>
