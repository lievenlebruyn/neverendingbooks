					<description><![CDATA[Dear Lieven

Best of luck with your book for large audience project !!!

Thanks for the review. Hmmm, I should have asked your advice about &quot;How to make a much better book out of it&quot;, and I am still curious about your ideas (perhaps for future versions). Actually, the idea to add drawing was suggested by Ken Binmore who read the 2009 version. Overall, the new book version has major editing additions and deletions compared to the 2009 version. (I do not think I have smart things to say about the math-blogging scene and its potential to attract more people to mathematics.)
