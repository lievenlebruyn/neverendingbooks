					<description><![CDATA[The Clique (Twenty Øne Piløts fanatic fanbase) is convinced that the nine Bishops of Dema were modelled after the Bourbaki-group. It is therefore of no&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twentyonepilots.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Clique">The Clique</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty Øne Piløts</a> fanatic fanbase) is convinced that the nine Bishops of Dema were modelled after the Bourbaki-group.</p>
<p>It is therefore of no surprise to see a Photoshopped version circulating of this classic picture of some youthful Bourbaki-members (note Jean-Pierre Serre poster-boying for Elon Musk&#8217;s site),</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BourbakiHeads.png" width=100%></p>
<p>replacing some of them with much older photos of other members. Crucial seems to be that there are just nine of them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/9Bourbakis.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether the Clique hijacked Bourbaki&#8217;s Wikipedia page, or whether they were inspired by its content to select those people, but if you look at that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Wikipedia page</a> you&#8217;ll see in the right hand column:</p>
<p><strong>Founders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Henri Cartan</li>
<li>Claude Chevalley</li>
<li>Jean Coulomb</li>
<li>Jean Delsarte</li>
<li>Jean Dieudonné</li>
<li>Charles Ehresmann</li>
<li>René de Possel</li>
<li>André Weil</li>
</ul>
<p>Really? Come on.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that Charles Ehresmann was brought in to replace Jean Leray, and Jean Coulomb to replace Paul Dubreil. Surely, replacements can&#8217;t be founders, can they?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately it is not quite that simple. There&#8217;s this silly semantic discussion: from what moment on can you call someone a Bourbaki-member&#8230;</p>
<p>The collective name &#8216;Nicolas Bourbaki&#8217; was adopted only at the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/where-is-the-royal-poldavian-academy">Bourbaki-congress in Besse</a> in July 1935 (see also <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-bumpy-road-to-the-first-bourbaki-congress">this post</a>).</p>
<p>But, before the Besse-meeting there were ten &#8216;proto-Bourbaki&#8217; meetings, the first one on December 10th, 1934 in Cafe Capoulade. These meetings have been described masterly by Liliane Beaulieu in <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/4320353/karen-v-h-parshall-a-parisian-cafe-and-ten-proto-bourbaki-">A Parisian Cafe and Ten Proto-Bourbaki Meetings (1934-35)</a> (btw. if you know a direct link to the pdf, please drop it in the comments).</p>
<p>During these early meetings, the group called itself &#8216;The Committee for the Treatise on Analysis&#8217;, and <em>not yet</em> Bourbaki, whence the confusion.</p>
<p>Do we take the Capoulade-1934 meeting as the origin of the Bourbaki group (in which case the founding-members would be Cartan, Chevalley, De Possel, Delsarte, Dieudonne, and Weil), or was the Bourbaki-group founded at the Besse-congress in 1935 (when Cartan, Chevalley, Coulomb, De Possel, Dieudonne, Mandelbrojt, and Weil were present)?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of which people were present at all meetings from December 1934 until the second Chancay-congress in September 1939, taken from <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-03434735v2/document">Gatien Ricotier ‘Projets collectifs et personnels autour de Bourbaki dans les années 1930 à 1950&#8242;</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/9Bourbakis2.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>07-1935 is the Besse-congress, 09-1936 is the &#8216;Escorial&#8217;-congress (or Chancay 1) and 09-1937 is the second Chancay-congress. The ten dates prior to July 1935 are the proto-Bourbaki meetings.</p>
<p>Even though Delsarte was not present at the Besse-1935 congress, and De Possel moved to Algiers and left Bourbaki in 1941, I assume most people would agree that the six people present at the first Capoulade-meeting (Cartan, Chevalley, De Possel, Delsarte, Dieudonne, and Weil) should certainly be counted among the Bourbaki founding members.</p>
<p>What about the others?</p>
<p>We can safely eliminate Dubreil: he was present at just one proto-Bourbaki meeting and left the group in April 1935.</p>
<p>Also Leray&#8217;s case is straightforward: he was even excluded from the Besse-meeting as he didn&#8217;t contribute much to the group, and later he vehemently opposed Bourbaki, as <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/dema2trench-and-repeat">we&#8217;ve seen</a>.</p>
<p>Coulomb&#8217;s role seems to restrict to securing a venue for the Besse-meeting as he was &#8216;physicien-adjoint&#8217; at the &#8216;Observatoire Physique du Globe du Puy-de-Dome&#8217;.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.archivesdepartementales.puy-de-dome.fr/img/thumbnails/497_688/ill_2_559fi2597bis_3.jpg?1508419869" width=50%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Because of this he could rarely attend the Julia-seminar or Bourbaki-meetings, and his interest in mathematical physics was a bit far from the themes pursued in the seminar or by Bourbaki. It seems he only contributed one small text, in the form of a letter. Due to his limited attendance, even after officially been asked to replace Dubreil, he can hardly be counted as a founding member.</p>
<p>This leaves Szolem Mandelbrojt and Charles Ehresmann.</p>
<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/top-photoshop-mysteries">We&#8217;ve already described</a> Mandelbrojt as the odd-man-out among the early Bourbakis. According to the Bourbaki archive he only contributed one text. On the other hand, he also played a role in organising the Besse-meeting and in providing financial support for Bourbaki. Because he was present already early on (from the second proto-Bourbaki meeting) until the Chancay-1937 meeting, some people will count him among the founding members.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn&#8217;t call Charles Ehresmann a Bourbaki founding member because he joined too late in the process (March 1936). Still, purists (those who argue that Bourbaki was founded at Besse) will say that at that meeting he was put forward to replace Jean Leray, and later contributed actively to Bourbaki&#8217;s meetings and work, and for that reason should be included among the founding members.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>How many Bourbaki founding members are there? Six (the Capoulade-gang), seven (+Mandelbrojt), eight (+Mandelbrojt and Ehresmann), or do you still think there were nine of them?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last pre-war Bourbaki congress, held in september 1938 in Dieulefit, is surrounded by mystery. Compared to previous meetings, fewer documents are preserved in the <a href="http://portail.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/">Bourbaki archives</a> and some sentences in the surviving notules have been made illegible. We will have to determine the exact location of the Dieulefit-meeting before we can understand why this had to be done. It&#8217;s Bourbaki&#8217;s own tiny contribution to &#8216;le miracle de silence&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/Bourbaki1938.jpg" align=left style="margin-right:10px;"> First, the few facts we know about this Bourbaki congress, mostly from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Weil">Andre Weil</a>&#8216;s autobiography <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Apprenticeship-Mathematician-Andre-Weil/dp/3764326506/">&#8216;The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>The meeting was held in <a href="http://www.drome-provence.com/villages/dieulefit.php">Dieulefit</a> in the Drome-Provencale region, sometime in september 1938 prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> (more on this next time). We know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Élie_Cartan">Elie Cartan</a> did accept Bourbaki&#8217;s invitation to join them and there is this one famous photograph of the meeting. From left to right : Simone Weil (accompanying Andre), Charles Pison, Andre Weil (hidden), Jean Dieudonne (sitting), Claude Chabauty, Charles Ehresmann, and Jean Delsarte.</p>
<p>Failing further written documentation, &#8216;all&#8217; we have to do in order to pinpoint the exact location of the meeting is to find a match between this photograph and some building in Dieulefit&#8230;</p>
<p>The crucial clue is provided by the couple of sentences, on the final page of the Bourbaki-archive document deldi_001 <a href="http://portail.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/deldi_001.pdf">Engagements de Dieulefit</a>, someone (Jean Delsarte?) has tried to make illegible (probably early on).</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/GeschrapteTekst.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>Blowing the picture up, it isn&#8217;t too hard to guess that the header should read &#8216;Décision du 22 septembre 1938&#8217; and that the first sentence is &#8216;Le Bourbaki de 2e classe WEIL fera pour le 15 octobre&#8217;. The document is signed</p>
<p>Camp de Beauvallon, le 22.IX.38.<br />
L&#8217;adjudant de jour<br />
DIEUDONNE</p>
<p>Now we are getting somewhere. Beauvallon is the name of an hamlet of Dieulefit, situated approximately 2.5km to the east of the center.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/Dieulefit.jpg"></p>
<p>Beauvallon is rather famous for its <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_de_Beauvallon">School</a>, founded in 1929 by <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Soubeyran">Marguerite Soubeyran</a> and <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Krafft">Catherine Krafft</a>, which was the first &#8216;modern&#8217; boarding school in France for both boys and girls having behavioral problems. From 1936 on the school&#8217;s director was <a href="http://www.lepost.fr/article/2008/09/03/1307302_simone-monnier-fondatrice-de-beauvallon.html">Simone Monnier</a>.</p>
<p>These three women were politically active and frequented several circles. Already in 1938 (at about the time of the Bourbaki congress) they knew the reality of the Nazi persecutions and planned to prepare their school to welcome, care for and protect refugees and Jewish children.</p>
<p>From 1936 on about 20 Spanish republican refugees found a home here and in the &#8216;pension&#8217; next to the school. When the war started, about 1500 people were hidden from the German occupation in Dieulefit (having a total population of 3500) : Jewish children, intellectuals, artists, trade union leaders, etc. etc. many in the Ecole and the Pension.</p>
<p>Because of the towns solidarity with the refugees, none were betrayed to the Germans, <a href="http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/miracle-a-dieulefit/920/0/229069">Le miracle de silence à Dieulefit</a>.<br />
It earned the three Ecole-women the title of &#8220;Juste&#8221; after the war. More on this period can be read <a href="http://www.clio-cr.clionautes.org/spip.php?article2993">here</a>.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with Bourbaki? Well, we claim that the venue of the 1938 Bourbaki congress was the <a href="http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-ecole-de-Beauvallon-263.html">Ecole de Beauvallon</a> and they probably used Le Pension for their lodgings.</p>
<p>We have photographic evidence comparing the Bourbaki picture with a picture taken in 1943 at the Ecole (the woman in the middle is Marguerite Soubeyran). Compare the distance between door and window, the division of the windows and the ivy on the wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/evidence1.jpg"></p>
<p>Below two photographs of the entire school building : on the left, the school with &#8216;Le Pension&#8217; next to it around 1938 (the ivy clad wall with the Bourbaki-door is to the right) and on the right, the present <a href="http://pagesperso-orange.fr/lesamisdebeauvallon/pages/0.html">Ecole de Beauvallon</a> (this site also contains a lot of historical material). The ivy has gone, but the main features of the building are still intact, only the shape of the small roof above the Bourbaki-door has changed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/evidence2.jpg"></p>
<p>During their stay, it is likely the Bourbakis became aware of the plans the school had would war break out. Probably, Jean Delsarte removed all explicit mention to the Ecole de Beauvallon from the archives upon their return. Bourbaki&#8217;s own small contribution to Dieulefit&#8217;s miracle of silence.</p>
