										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Chad Orzel is able <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Teach-Quantum-Physics-Your/dp/1851687793" title="How to teach quantum theory to your dog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to teach quantum theory to his dog</a>, surely it must be possible to explain schemes, stacks, toposes and motives to hipsters?</p>
<p>Perhaps an idea for a series of posts?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days yet. So far, I&#8217;ve only added the tag <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/tag/sga4hipsters" title="tagged sga4hipsters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sga4hipsters</a> (pun intended) and googled around for &#8216;real-life&#8217; applications of sheaves, cohomology, and worse.</p>
<p>Sooner or later one ends up at David Spivak&#8217;s <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/" title="David Spivak MIT webpage">MIT-webpage</a>.</p>
<p>David has written a book &#8220;category theory for scientists&#8221; and has several papers on applications of category theory to databases.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also this hilarious abstract, reproduced below, of a talk he gave in 2007 at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~mcf/2007/" title="many cheerful facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many cheerful facts</a>.</p>
<p>If this guy ever decides to write a novel, I&#8217;ll pre-order it on the spot.</p>

<p><strong>Presheaf, the cobbler.</strong><br />
<strong><em>by David Spivak</em></strong></p>
<p>Children have always loved colimits.</p>
<p>Whether it be sorting their blocks according to color, gluing a pair of googly eyes and a pipe-cleaner onto a piece of yellow construction paper, or simply eating a peanut butter sandwich, colimits play a huge role in their lives.</p>
<p>But what happens when their category doesn’t have enough colimits?</p>
<p>In today’s ”ownership” society, what usually happens is that the parents upgrade their child’s category to a Presheaf category. Then the child can cobble together crazy constructions to his heart’s content.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a kid comes up to you with an FM radio she built out of tinkertoys, and says<br />
”look what I made! I call it ’182 transisters, 11 diodes, 6 plastic walls, 3 knobs,&#8230;’”</p>
<p>They seem to go on about the damn thing forever.</p>
<p>Luckily, Grothendieck put a stop to this madness.</p>
<p>He used to say to them, ever so gently, ”I’m sorry, kid. I’m really proud of you for making this ’182 transistors’ thing, but I’m afraid it already has a name. It’s called a radio.</p>
<p>And thus Grothendieck apologies were born.</p>
<p>Two years later, Grothendieck topologies were born of the same concept.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will teach you to build a radio (that really works!) using only a category of presheaves, and then I will tell you about the patent-police, known as Grothendieck topologies.</p>
<p>God willing, I will get through SGA 4 and Lurie’s book on Higher Topos Theory.&#8221;</p>
