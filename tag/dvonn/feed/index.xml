										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has<br />
been a difficult design decision, but I‚Äôm going to replace the <a href="http://www.sixthform.info/steve/wordpress/">LaTeXRender WordPress<br />
Plugin</a> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">mathML</a> as the<br />
default TeX-interface for NeverEndingBooks. I will keep LaTeXRender on<br />
standby as I may have to use exotic packages or commands that iTeX does<br />
not deliver, but for most math-related posts, MathML will do the job<br />
nicely (as <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">the n-category<br />
cafe</a> shows every day (or even more often)). Not that I stopped being<br />
a dilettante but I&#8217;m going to do most of my writings (including<br />
blog-posts) using <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/">Scrivener</a> (more on this<br />
another time) and Scrivener supports <a href="http://fletcher.freeshell.org/wiki/MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a> and allows exporting to LaTeX and XHTML (using MathML).</p>
</p>
<p>I could never have pulled this off in such a short time without <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/">Jacques Distler</a><br />
more or less on constant stand-by (thanks Jacques!). Looking at the<br />
times his emails were send I have no idea in which time zone he lives<br />
(let alone sleeps&#8230;). So, here a walk-through the changes :</p>
<p>As<br />
I&#8217;m on WP 2.0.5 I&#8217;ll start with Frederick&#8217; <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/litlfred/mathBlog/projects/itextomml">post</a>. He tells me I have to install first the itex2MML binary as<br />
explained <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000367.html">by<br />
Jacques</a> but I find that there is more recent <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/itex2MMLcommands.html"><br />
material</a> and therefore download the most recent imath2MML-package<br />
and follow the readme. There is a Mac OSX binary but it&#8217;s not clear<br />
for what processor (PPC/Intel/Binary) but a quick mail to Jacques learns<br />
me that it&#8217;s PPC which is fine by me but on the spot he puts a<br />
universal binary online, so whatever your Mac is you can just download<br />
the binary, copy it to /usr/local/bin and make sure its chmodded<br />
755.</p>
<p>Back to Frederick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/litlfred/mathBlog/projects/itextomml">post</a>, download and install the plugin itexToMML.php in the usual way<br />
(fortunately I spot just in time that I have to change one line saying<br />
where my itex2MML binary is (in Frederick&#8217;s file it is NOT the default<br />
location)). You can verify whether the plugin and itex2MML do what they<br />
are supposed to do by typing a LaTeX-command in a post and save it. The<br />
output will not produce the desired formula but have a look at the<br />
source file and see whether there is some mathML code in it. If so,<br />
fine! If not, go back and check everything.</p>
<p>If this works, it is<br />
&#8220;merely&#8221; a problem of getting your mathML served. Frederick suggests<br />
to unpack wordpress_mathML.zip in the wp-includes directory (but you<br />
better make sure you have made a copy of the original class.php and<br />
functions-formatting.php files. In the end I decided against this<br />
approach (that is, to replace only the functions-formatting.php but NOT<br />
the class.php file). If you have two or more themes you want to<br />
maintain, it is probably better to change the headers (because this is<br />
what we have to do to get mathML served) only in those themes which are<br />
XML-sound. In my case, the Command Line Interface theme most certainly is NOT!!!).</p>
<p>Go to your<br />
theme-files and look for the header.php (or similar) file and replace<br />
the default header by the code in the addendum to <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000367.html"><br />
this post</a> within php-tags. If you can go to your blog-page then you<br />
are in good shape and things should work well (apart possibly from<br />
layout considerations, see below). Of course, in my case i was greeted<br />
by &#8221; XML &#8220;yellow screen of death&#8221; (as Jacques calls<br />
it) and I was convinced I did something wrong, so I tried out several<br />
useless things for a couple of hours before it dawned on me that the<br />
reason might just be that my blog-files were not valid XHTML (and the<br />
new headers are very demanding on serving only well-form XHTML). I had<br />
to modify all changes I made to sidebars etc. as well as rewrite parts<br />
of my first posts (I used to take a rather liberal view on writing<br />
blog-posts, writing a mixture between Markdown and improvised HTML and<br />
in the process was very lax about closing IMG-tags and the likes).<br />
But after some time and numerous corrections to the files I got the<br />
main-page up and running (and even had the mathML served as a readable<br />
formula) apart from the fact that I barely recognized my own site.</p>
<p>I printed out source files of the page with and without changed<br />
headers and couldn‚Äôt find a difference. So, it had to do with the<br />
CSS-style files, but why on earth would the new headers be picky about<br />
CSS? But as a last resort, after narrowing the search down to one<br />
CSS-line, I asked Jacques whether he had an idea what went on. His reply<br />
will be remembered for quite some time :</p>
<blockquote><p>A fascinating<br />
question.  The answer is that it *is* following the CSS directive, but<br />
in XHTML, &#8216;body&#8217; is not what you think it is.  &#8216;body&#8217; is just big enough<br />
to contain its content. It does not fill the viewport. &#8216;html&#8217; fills the<br />
viewport.  The solution (a solution) is described in<br />
http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000203.html
</p></blockquote>
<p>Many hours later, I still haven‚Äôt got a clue what<br />
this is all about, but I blindly followed the hint and surely all<br />
problems vanished. In short, another day wasted in front of a<br />
computer-screen.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m back to old headers and<br />
will not be writing mathML for some time as I have the vast job ahead to<br />
validate all my previous posts to XHTML-standards (if not you would see<br />
more yellows screens of death than anything else. So, here‚Äôs the<br />
strategy I&#8217;ll be taking in the weeks ahead (I&#8217;ll sleep on it tonight<br />
so if any of you think there is a better way, reply quickly)</p>
<ul>
<li>rewrite each and every post in proper MultiMarkdown using iTeX for<br />
the most common math and only resorting to LaTeXRender for exotic things<br />
(such as Sudoku, Chess, Dvonn) and run these posts through Markdown<br />
(to get basic HTML and all links in place).</li>
<li>download these<br />
files to the WP-database (so that in the CLI-interface you will be able<br />
to follow all links, but will read all iTeX as TeX-commands (as the<br />
command line intended after all).</li>
<li>in the process change all<br />
broken links to the default permalink-structure (with index.php?p=231 or<br />
so).</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, this is a work that will take a couple of<br />
weeks but it may be fun to reread these old posts and possibly add new<br />
information about the subjects. When I‚Äôm making these changes, I‚Äôll<br />
use the new headers so if you are using a smart browser look out for the<br />
yellow screens. When they happen, either use a dumb browser (such as<br />
Safari) or go into CLI-interface mode where everything should still<br />
work. I plan to start with the oldest posts as this seems more fun to<br />
me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the<br />
[previous post](https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php?p=309%29 we have<br />
seen that it is important to have lots of mobile pieces around in the<br />
endgame and that it is hard for a computer-program to evaluate a<br />
position correctly. In fact, we illustrated this with a position which<br />
&#8216;clearly&#8217; looks much better for Black (the computer) whereas it is<br />
already lost!  In fact, the computer lost this particular game already 7<br />
plies earlier. Consider the position</p>

<p>Probably, Black lost the<br />
game with its last move d1-f3 thereby disconnecting its pieces into two<br />
clusters. White (the human player) must already have realized at this<br />
moment he had a good chance of winning (as indicated in the previous<br />
post) by letting Black run out of moves by building large stacks on the<br />
third row, White building a stack of the appropriate size which then<br />
jumps on the largest Black stack on the final move. Btw. this technique<br />
is called *sharpshooting*  in Dvonn-parlance  </p>
<blockquote><p> The concept<br />
of manipulating the height of a stack so that it can land precisely on a<br />
critical space. It&#8217;s a matter of counting and one-digit addition. Notice<br />
that this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean putting your own stacks atop one<br />
another &#8211; the best sharpshooting moves are moves which also neutralize.<br />
To counter a sharpshooting move is called &#8220;spoiling&#8221;. </p></blockquote>
<p>  But<br />
for this strategy to have a chance, White must keep the Black stacks<br />
containing the Dvonn pieces on the third row. At the moment the stack on<br />
c3 can move to c1 or  to c5 and with his next move White counters this<br />
by *overloading* the stack, that is  </p>
<blockquote><p> To spoil a move or<br />
prevent a lifting move by moving atop the enemy stack. Even if the<br />
opponent has enough control to retake the stack, he cannot move it<br />
because it has become taller. </p></blockquote>
<p>  So, White sacrifies his<br />
height 4 stack on g3 with the move g3-c3. Black must take back<br />
immediately (if not, White moves c3-i3 and all Black&#8217;s material in  the<br />
farmost right cluster is lost) but now the previously mobile Black<br />
height 2 stack at c3 has become an immobile (or *old stack*) height 7<br />
stack which has no option but to stay on c3 (clearly Black will never<br />
move it to j3&#8230;).  Next, White performs a similar startegy to<br />
neutralize the *young* height 3 Black stack on f3 by overloading it by 2<br />
and hence after the forced recapture it becomes a height 6 Black stack<br />
which must remain on f3 forever. Here are the actual moves  1) g3-c3<br />
b2-c3   2) h2-h3 b4-c5   3) h3-f3 e2-f3    and we end up with the<br />
situation we analyzed last time, that is</p>

<p>The<br />
reason behind this unwanted clipping is that Latexrender uses<br />
**convert** to take the relevant part of a ps-page containing only the<br />
TeXed formula on an empty page by performing clipping and then converts<br />
it into a GIF-file (or any other format you desire). The obvious way<br />
round this is to enlarge my template by adding two additional rows and<br />
columns and putting visible nonsense there (such as dots) to enlarge the<br />
relevant part so that no clipping is done of essential info. But then<br />
(1) the picture generated becomes even larger than that above and (2) I<br />
don&#8217;t want you to see the extra nonsensical dots&#8230;  The essential line<br />
in the **class.latexrender.php** file is</p>
<p><code>$command =<br />
$this->_convert_path." -density ".$this->_formula_density.<br />
    " -trim -transparent \"#FFFFFF\" ".$this->_tmp_filename.".ps ".<br />
             $this->_tmp_filename.".".$this->_image_format; </code></p>
<p>             So<br />
I needed to delve into the [manual pages for the convert command](http://amath.colorado.edu/computing/software/man/convert.html)<br />
of the ImageMagick-package. To my surprise, the *-trim* option (which I<br />
thought to adjust somewhat by adding parameters) doesn&#8217;t exist! Still, I<br />
got around my second problem using the *crop* option and around the<br />
first by using the very useful *geometry* option. The latter is also<br />
useful if you find that the size of the output of Latexrender is not<br />
compatible with the size of your regular text. Of course you can amend<br />
this somewhat by using the *extarticle* documentclass (as suggested) but<br />
if you want to further adjust it, use for example</p>
<p><code> -geometry<br />
86%</code></p>
<p>to size the output to exactly 86% (or whatever you need).<br />
So, whenever I want to do some Dvonn-blogging from now on I&#8217;ll change my<br />
class.latexrender.php file as follows</p>
<p><code>  $command =<br />
$this->_convert_path." -crop 0x0-10% -crop 0x0+10% -density<br />
".$this->_formula_density.                     " -geometry 80%<br />
-transparent \"#FFFFFF\" ".$this->_tmp_filename.".ps ".<br />
   $this->_tmp_filename.".".$this->_image_format; </code></p>
<p>   which<br />
produces the output</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Dvonn](http://www.gipf.com/dvonn $ is<br />
the fourth game in the [Gipf Project](http://www.gipf.com/project_gipf/index.html) and the most<br />
mathematical of all six. It is a very fast (but subtle) game with a<br />
simple [set of rules](http://www.gipf.com/dvonn/rules/rules.html). Here<br />
is a short version  </p>
<blockquote><p> DVONN is a stacking game. It is played<br />
on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red<br />
DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players first<br />
place the DVONN-pieces on the board and next their own pieces. Then they<br />
start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved<br />
1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces,<br />
etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end<br />
on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with<br />
the DVONN pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends<br />
when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control<br />
on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.<br />
That&#8217;s all!  </p></blockquote>
<p>  All this will become clearer once we fix a<br />
specific end-game, for example</p>

<p>with<br />
White to move. Some comments about notation : the left-slanted columns<br />
are denoted by letters from a (left) to k (right) and the rows are<br />
labeled 1 to 5 from bottom to top (surprisingly this &#8216;standard&#8217;<br />
webgame-notation differs from the numbering on my Dvonn-board where the<br />
rows are labeled from top to bottom&#8230;). So, for example, the three<br />
spots on the upper right are k3,k4 and k5 (there are no k1 or k2 spots).<br />
The three Dvonn pieces are colored red and in the course of the game a<br />
stack may land on a Dvonn piece and so stacks containing a Dvonn piece<br />
are denoted with a red halo. For example, the symbol on spot f3 stands<br />
for for a stack of 6 pieces, one of which is a red Dvonn piece, under<br />
the control of Black (that is, the top-piece is Black).  Further note<br />
that a piece or stack can only move if it is not surrounded by 6 other<br />
pieces or stacks (so the White pieces on j3 and j4 cannot (yet) move). A<br />
piece can only move by one step in either line-direction provided there<br />
is another piece or stack on that position. The same applies for stacks<br />
: an height 3 stack for example can move in each lin-direction by<br />
exactly 3 steps provided there is a piece or stack to jump onto. For<br />
example, the height 6 stack on d4 can only move to j4 whereas the height<br />
6 stack on f3 cannot move at all! Similarly, the two black height 5<br />
stacks are immobile. At the moment black has all its stacks defended,<br />
that is, if White should be able to jump onto one of them (which White<br />
cannot at the moment), Black can use one of its neighbouring pieces to<br />
take the stack back under its control.   So, any computer program would<br />
&#8216;evaluate&#8217; the position as favourable for Black : Black has stacks of<br />
total height 34 safely under control (there are no immediate threats to<br />
be seen : the [horizon effect](http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/aai-aied/people/paulb/old243prolog/subsection3_7_5.html) in such programs) whereas White<br />
can only claim  potential stacks of total height 13&#8230;   Still, Black<br />
has already lost the game. White has more pieces which are quite mobile<br />
as opposed to the immobile black stacks, so Black will soon run out of<br />
moves to make and his end position will have some large stacks on the<br />
third row. All white has to do is to let Black run out of moves and then<br />
continue (Dvonn forces each player to make a move if they still can and<br />
to pass the move otherwise, so the most mobile player can still continue<br />
long after the other player was forced to stop) to build a White stack<br />
of the appropriate height on the third row to jump on the highest Black<br />
stack with its last move!  Here is how the play continued :  1) j2-k3 ;<br />
a3-b3   2) i1-k3 ; c5-c3   3) i2-i3  ; c2-c3   4) i3-k3 ; d4-j4   5)<br />
j3-j4  ; e3-f3     6) i4-j4  ; c4-b3    to arrive at the position where<br />
Black is no longer able to make any moves at all</p>

<p>Note that all pieces and stacks no longer<br />
connected to a Dvonn piece must be removed. So, for example, after the<br />
third move by Black, the Black height 5 stacks on c1 was removed. All<br />
white now has to do is to built an height 8 stack on k3 and jump onto<br />
the height 10 Black stack on c3 to win the game. The (only) way to do<br />
this is by 7. j5-k5 and 8. k5-k3 to finish with 9. k3-c3 with final<br />
position (note again that the White right-hand pieces and stacks are no<br />
longer connected to a Dvonn piece and are hence removed)</p>
