										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> In the early days of math-blogging, one was happy to get <a href="http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm">LaTeXRender</a> working. Some years later, the majority of math-blogs were using the, more user-friendly, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-latex/">wp-latex plugin</a> to turn LaTeX-code into png-images. Today, everyone uses <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> which works with modern CSS and web fonts instead of equation images, so equations scale with surrounding text at all zoom levels.</p>
<p> However, MathJax has one downside : it doesn&#8217;t parse in ePub-readers. Peter Krautzberger wrote a post <a href="http://peter.krautzberger.info/2011/07/Epub-and-mathematics">Epub and mathematics</a> in which he suggested two methods to turn MathJax into ePub, but after dozens of experiments I still fail to reproduce these.</p>
<p> No doubt, someone will soon come up with a working alternative, but for the impatient here&#8217;s a quick but dirty method to turn your MathJax powered wordpress post into ePub :</p>
<h2>the tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>download and install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">ePub export plugin</a>. It automatically creates an ePub file when a post or page is published or updated. The ePubs are stored in the uploads directory (to be found in the wp-contents directory).  </li>
<li>download and install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-latex/">wp-latex plugin</a>. MathJax uses the normal \$ tex-delimeters whereas wp-latex requires \$latex, so this plugin doesn&#8217;t interfere with the default use of MathJax.  </li>
<li>download the <a href="http://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2009/03/01/latex2wp-update/">wp2latex python script</a>. It converts a standard LaTeX file into a format that is ready to be copied into WordPress.  </li>
</ul>
<h2>the routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>Edit the post you want to convert to ePub. Copy the contents of the post box to a file say post1.tex and save this in the same directory containing the latex2wp.py script.  </li>
<li>In Terminal go to that directory and type the command &#8216;python latex2wp.py post1.tex&#8217;. It will produce a new file post1  in the same directory.  </li>
<li>Copy the contents of post1  into the post box of your WordPress-post and press the update button. This time the TeX-commands in your post will be rendered using wp-latex and the ePub export-plugin will have created an ePub-version of it.  </li>
<li>Locate this newly created ePub file in the relevant wp-contents/uploads/ folder (file has a number.epub name) and, if wanted, change its name into something easier to recognize and copy it somewhere outside the uploads directory. This will be your desired ePub-version of the post.  </li>
<li>Replace the contents of the post box of your WordPress-post with the contents of the post1.tex file and hit the &#8216;Update&#8217; button, to restore your original post (powered by MathJax).  </li>
<li>Email your ePub-file to your iPad and open it with iBooks. Not quite as nice as MathJax-parsed TeX but a lot better than reading unparsed TeX-commands.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps, the tips and tricks I did receive to turn a selection of wordpress-posts into a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">ePub</a>-file may be of use to others, so I will describe the procedure here in some detail.</p>
<p>It makes a difference whether or not some of the posts contain TeX. This time, I&#8217;ll sketch the process for non-LaTeX posts and hence we will turn the Bourbaki-code posts into ePub-format to read on your iPad, rather than merely into a pdf-file as <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/ebook-the-bourbaki-code-v1-0.html">last time</a>. Next time, I&#8217;ll add some tricks to repeat this when some of your posts do contain LaTeX.</p>
<p><strong>1. Install the ePub export plugin</strong></p>
<p>Get the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/epub-export/">epub export</a> wordpress plugin, install and activate it in the usual way. ePub Export automatically creates an ePub file when a post or page is published or updated. The ePubs are stored in the uploads directory. For later use, remember that your uploads directories are located under BLOGHOME/wp-content/uploads.</p>
<p><strong>2. Update the posts you want to include</strong></p>
<p>Decide which posts you want to include in your eBook, edit them (or not) and press for each one of them the update-button. This will populate today&#8217;s uploads-directory with a number of epub-files. Transfer them all, for example using <a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, to a directory on your home-computer, named say MyFirstEBook.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/epub1.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>3. Unpack the epub-files</strong></p>
<p>The crucial fact to remember about epub-files is that they are really zipped archives containing xhtml-, css- and other files and directories. As we want to edit some of those, we first have to unpack the directories. So, change the .epub extensions to .zip and double-click on them to create the directories.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/epub2.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>The crucial files in each directory are preface.xhtml (containing title author and blog-name), text.html (containing the blog-post) and the images-directory (containing copies of all the images used in the post).</p>
<p><strong>4. Rename the directories user-friendly</strong></p>
<p>As all the posts will be chapters in our eBook in some specific order, we will rename the numbers of the directories to something more user-friendly such as shortened blog-titles. To do this, double-click in each of the directories on the preface.xhtml file. This will open Safari and will show the title of the blog-post. Use it to rename that directory. For convenience let us call the directory corresponding to the first chapter in our book MasterDirectory</p>
<p><strong>5. Move all images to the master directory</strong></p>
<p>For each of the other chapter-directories, drag all the files contained in the images-subdirectory to MasterDirectory/images.</p>
<p><strong>6. Edit the MasterDirectory/text.xhtml file</strong></p>
<p>Because we will have to open and copy-paste all the text.xhtml files of the different directories, it is perhaps best to rename momentarily the MasterDirectory/text.xhtml file to something like master.xhtml.</p>
<p>Now, open this file with a text-processor such as <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>. Edit it to remove unwanted html-code (such as links to other posts at the start if you are using the series-plugin, or previous/next post links at the end). Also add the title of the blog-post between h1-tags (and if you want to include a table of contents later, give it an anchor-name).</p>
<p>Go to the directory of your second chapter, open that text.xhtml file and copy/paste only the post-content over to the master-xhtml file at the appropriate place. As before, add title/anchor before the copied post-content.</p>
<p>Repeat this procedure, in order, for all the chapters of your eBook.</p>
<p>Once finished, doubleclick the master.xhtml file and correct remaining errors (as it is an xhtml-file, it is rather picky about opening and closing tags) and see whether all your images are included. If you&#8217;re satisfied with it, rename the master.xhtml to text.xhtml (don&#8217;t forget this!).</p>
<p><strong>7. Edit the MasterDirectory/preface.xhtml file</strong></p>
<p>Open the preface.xhtml file and change the first blogpost-title to the title of your booklet, alter your name (by default it uses your wp-nick) and add a frontipiece-picture if you so desire.</p>
<p><strong>8. Re-package the directory into an epub-file</strong></p>
<p>This is the (only) tricky part. E-book readers require that the mimetype file is the first one in the zip document. What&#8217;s more, to be fully compliant, this file should start at a very specific point &#8211; a 30-byte offset from the beginning of the zip file (so that the mimetype text itself starts at byte 38).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to do this on a Mac (Linux-users being the geeks they are will have given up on reading this post a while ago and as to Windows-users, yeah well &#8230;). Open Terminal.app and cd to your MasterDirectory. Now type:</p>
<p>zip -X MyFirstEBook.epub mimetype</p>
<p>Next, type:</p>
<p>zip -rg MyFirstEBook.epub * -x &#42;.DS_Store</p>
<p>(of course you&#8217;ll have to change your book-title to whatever you want). If you want to know more about these 2 magical commands, read <a href="http://www.webvivant.com/zipping-epub-files.html">this post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9. Edit metadata</strong></p>
<p>Get <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> and add the MyFirstEBook.epub to Calibre by clicking on the &#8216;Add Books&#8217; button.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/epub3.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>You can preview your eBook by clicking on the &#8216;View&#8217;-button. Next, click the &#8216;Edit metadata&#8217;-button and alter the title and author entries (and whatever else you want to include) and click the OK button. Then click &#8216;Save to disk&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>10. Read your eBook on your iPad</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we want to see how it looks on the iPad. Mail MyFirstEBook.epub to yourself as attachement, open it with iBooks and enjoy!</p>
