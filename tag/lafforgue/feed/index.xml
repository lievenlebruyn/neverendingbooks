										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/against-toposes">recent post</a> I recalled Claude Levy-Strauss&#8217; observation “In Paris, intellectuals need a new toy every 15 years”, and gave a couple of links showing that the most recent IHES-toy has been spreading to other Parisian intellectual circles in recent years.</p>
<p>At the time (late sixties), Levy-Strauss was criticising the ongoing Foucault-hype. It appears that, since then, the frequency of <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-hype-cycle-of-an-idea">a hype cycle</a> is getting substantially shorter.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, the IHES announced that <a href="https://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/467008">Dustin Clausen</a> (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_mathematics">condensed math</a> fame) is now joining the IHES as <a href="https://www.ihes.fr/en/dustin-clausen-joins-ihes/">a permanent professor</a>.</p>
<p>To me, this seems like a sensible decision, moving away from (too?) general topos theory towards explicit examples having potential applications to arithmetic geometry.</p>
<p>On the relation between condensed sets and toposes, here&#8217;s Dustin Clausen talking about &#8220;Toposes generated by compact projectives, and the example of condensed sets&#8221;, at the &#8220;Toposes online&#8221; conference, organised by Alain Connes, Olivia Caramello and Laurent Lafforgue in 2021.</p>

<p>Two days ago, Clausen gave another interesting (inaugural?) talk at the IHES on &#8220;A Conjectural Reciprocity Law for Realizations of Motives&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>January 13th, Gallimard published</a> Grothendieck&#8217;s text <a href="https://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Tel/Recoltes-et-Semailles-I-II#">Recoltes et Semailles</a> in a fancy box containing two books.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://ec56229aec51f1baff1d-185c3068e22352c56024573e929788ff.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/attachments/large/4/3/9/009916439.jpg" width=40% \><br />
</center></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a G-translation of Gallimard&#8217;s blurb:</p>
<p>&#8220;Considered the mathematical genius of the second half of the 20th century, Alexandre Grothendieck is the author of Récoltes et semailles, a kind of “monster” of more than a thousand pages, according to his own words. The mythical typescript, which opens with a sharp criticism of the ethics of mathematicians, will take the reader into the intimate territories of a spiritual experience after having initiated him into radical ecology.</p>
<p>In this literary braid, several stories intertwine, “a journey to discover a past; a meditation on existence; a picture of the mores of a milieu and an era (or the picture of the insidious and implacable shift from one era to another…); an investigation (almost police at times, and at others bordering on the swashbuckling novel in the depths of the mathematical megapolis…); a vast mathematical digression (which will sow more than one…); […] a diary ; a psychology of discovery and creation; an indictment (ruthless, as it should be…), even a settling of accounts in “the beautiful mathematical world” (and without giving gifts…)”.&#8221;</p>
<p>All literary events, great or small, are cause for the French to fill a radio show.</p>
<p>January 21st, <a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/l-invite-de-8h20-le-grand-entretien/l-invite-de-8h20-le-grand-entretien-du-vendredi-21-janvier-2022"> &#8216;Le grand entretien&#8217; on France Inter</a> invited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Villani">Cedric Villani</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Bourguignon">Jean-Pierre Bourguignon</a> to talk about Grothendieck&#8217;s influence on mathematics (h/t <a href="http://www-lmpa.univ-littoral.fr/~stubbe/">Isar Stubbe</a>).</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZfkNlooqLw?start=726" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The embedded YouTube above starts at 12:06, when Bourguignon describes Grothendieck&#8217;s main achievements.</p>
<p>Clearly, he starts off with the notion of schemes which, he says, proved to be decisive in the further development of algebraic geometry. Five years ago, I guess he would have continued mentioning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">FLT</a> and other striking results, impossible to prove without scheme theory.</p>
<p>Now, he goes on saying that Grothendieck laid the basis of topos theory (&#8220;to define it, I would need not one minute and a half but a year and a half&#8221;), which is only now showing its first applications.</p>
<p>Grothendieck, Bourguignon goes on, was the first to envision the true potential of this theory, which we should take very seriously according to people like Lafforgue and Connes, and which will have applications in fields far from algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>Topos20 is spreading <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/huawei-and-topos-theory">rapidly</a> among French mathematicians. We&#8217;ll have to await further results before Topos20 will become a pandemic.</p>
<p>Another interesting fragment starts at 16:19 and concerns <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/grothendiecks-gribouillis">Grothendieck&#8217;s gribouillis</a>, the 50.000 pages of scribblings found in Lasserre after his death.</p>
<p>Bourguignon had the opportunity to see them some time ago, and when asked to describe them he tells they are in &#8216;caisses&#8217; stacked in a &#8216;libraire&#8217;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of these crates taken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Schneps">Leila Schneps</a> in Lasserre around the time of Grothendieck&#8217;s funeral.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/Boxes2.jpg" width=100% \><br />
</center></p>
<p>If you want to know what&#8217;s in these notes, and how they ended up at that place in Paris, you might want to read <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/grothendiecks-gribouillis-2">this</a> and <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/where-are-grothendiecks-writings-2">that</a> post.</p>
<p>If Bourguignon had to consult these notes at the Librairie Alain Brieux, it seems that there is no progress in the negotiations with Grothendieck&#8217;s children to make them public, or at least accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apart from the initiatives I mentioned <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/huawei-and-french-mathematics">last time</a>, Huawei set up a long term collaboration with the IHES, the <a href="https://www.ihes.fr/en/launch-huawei-young-talents-program/">Huawei Young Talents Program</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every year, the Huawei Young Talents Program will fund on average 7 postdoctoral fellowships that will be awarded by the Institute’s Scientific Council, only on the basis of scientific excellence. The fellows will collaborate with the Institute’s permanent professors and work on topics of their interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the next ten years, Huawei will invest 5 million euros in this program, and an additional 1 million euros goes into the creation of the &#8216;Huawei Chair in Algebraic Geometry&#8217;. It comes as no particular surprise that the first chairholder is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Lafforgue">Laurent Lafforgue</a>.</p>
<p>At the launch of this Young Talents Program in November 2020, Lafforgue gave a talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LP4pANpKrcs">The creative power of categories: History and some new perspectives</a>.</p>
<p>The latter part of the talk (starting at 47:50) clarifies somewhat Huawei&#8217;s interest in topos theory, and what Lafforgue (and others) hope to get out of their collaboration with the telecom company.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LP4pANpKrcs?start=2870" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Clearly, Huawei is interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep neural networks</a>, and if you can convince them your expertise is useful in that area, perhaps they&#8217;ll trow some money at you.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=foOK-F8AAAAJ&#038;hl=fr">Jean-Claude Belfiore</a>, another mathematician turned Huaweian, is convinced topos theory is the correct tool to study DNNs. Here&#8217;s his Huawei-clip from which it is clear he was originally hired to improve <a href="https://www.ft.com/brandsuite/huawei/huawei-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-science/index.html">Huawei&#8217;s polar code</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAEMEwYqSto" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>At the 2018 IHES-Topos conference he gave the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wnz9ADf8zk">Toposes for Wireless Networks: An idea whose time has come</a>, and recently he arXived the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14587">Topos and Stacks of Deep Neural Networks</a>, written jointly with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bennequin">Daniel Bennequin</a>. Probably, I&#8217;ll come back to this paper another time, for now, the nForum has <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13133/understanding-preprint-topos-and-stacks-of-deep-neural-networks/">this page</a> on it.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his talk, Lafforgue suggests the idea of creating an institute devoted to toposes and their applications, endorsed by IHES and supported by Huawei. Surely he knows that the <a href="https://topos.institute/">Topos Institute</a> already exists.</p>
<p>And, if you wonder why Huawei trows money at IHES rather than your university, I leave you with Lafforgue&#8217;s parting words:</p>
<p>&#8220;IHES professors are able to think and evaluate for themselves, whereas most mathematicians just follow &#8216;group thinking'&#8221;</p>
<p>Ouch!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, appears to support (and divide) the French mathematical community.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Lafforgue">Laurent Lafforgue&#8217;s</a> affiliation recently changed from &#8216;IHES&#8217; to &#8216;Huawei&#8217;, for example <a href="https://utge.lakecomoschool.org/">here</a> as one of the organisers of the Lake Como conference on &#8216;Unifying themes in geometry&#8217;.</p>
<p>Judging from this short Huawei-clip (in French) he thoroughly enjoys his new position.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EqrNLuN5Bfk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Huawei <a href="https://inf.news/en/science/0b03792c7ee5879f723ea9ffaa608e60.html">claims</a> that &#8216;Three more winners of the highest mathematics award have now joined Huawei&#8217;:</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Kontsevich">Maxim Kontsevich</a>, (IHES) Fields medal 1998</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Louis_Lions">Pierre-Louis Lions</a> (College de France) Fields medal 1994</p>
<p>&#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessio_Figalli">Alessio Figalli</a> (ETH) Fields medal 2018</p>
<p>These news-stories seem to have been G-translated from the Chinese, resulting in misspellings and perhaps other inaccuracies. Maxim&#8217;s research field is described as &#8216;kink theory&#8217; (LoL).</p>
<p>Apart from luring away Fields medallist, Huawei set up last year the brand new <a href="https://www.huawei.com/fr/news/fr/2020/centre-lagrange">Huawei Lagrange Research Center</a> in the posh 7th arrondissement de Paris. (This &#8216;Lagrange Center&#8217; is different from the <a href="http://ilp.upmc.fr/">Lagrange Institute in Paris</a> devoted to astronomy and physics.)</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/LagrangeCenter.jpg" width=100% \><br />
</center></p>
<p>It aims to host about 30 researchers in mathematics and computer science, giving them the opportunity to live in the &#8216;unique eco-system of Paris, having the largest group of mathematicians in the world, as well as the best universities&#8217;.</p>
<p>Last May, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Brou%C3%A9">Michel Broué</a> authored an open letter to the French mathematical community <a href="https://blogs.mediapart.fr/michel-broue/blog/180521/dans-un-hotel-particulier-du-7eme-arrondissement-de-paris">Dans un hotel particulier du 7eme arrondissement de Paris</a> (in French). A G-translation of the final part of this open letter:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the context of a very insufficient research and development effort in France, and bleak prospects for our young researchers, it is tempting to welcome the creation of the Lagrange center. We welcome the rise of Chinese mathematics to the highest level, and we are obviously in favour of scientific cooperation with our Chinese colleagues.</p>
<p>But in view of the role played by Huawei in the repression in Xinjiang and potentially everywhere in China, we call on mathematicians and computer scientists already engaged to withdraw from this project. We ask all researchers not to participate in the activities of this center, as we ourselves are committed to doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the mathematicians signing the letter are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Cartier_(mathematician)">Pierre Cartier</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Schapira_(mathematician)">Pierre Schapira</a>.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>
