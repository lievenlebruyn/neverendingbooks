										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/mathblogging.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/mathblogging.jpg" alt="" title="mathblogging" width="255" height="128" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4747" /></a> <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/">Mathblogging.org</a> is a recent initiative and may well become the default starting place to check on the status of the mathematical blogosphere.</p>
</p>
<p>Handy, if you want to (re)populate your RSS-aggregator with interesting mathematical blogs, is their graphical presentation of (nearly) all math-blogs <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/bytype">ordered by type</a> : group blogs, individual researchers, teachers and educators, journalistic writers, communities, institutions and microblogging (twitter). Links to the last 7 posts are given so you can easily determine whether that particular blog is of interest to you.</p>
<p>The three people behind the project, <a href="http://www.felixbreuer.net/">Felix Breuer</a>, <a href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/wst/users/heymann/">Frederik von Heymann</a> and <a href="http://peter.krautzberger.info/">Peter Krautzberger</a>, welcome you to send them links to (micro)blogs they&#8217;ve missed. Surely, there must be a lot more mathematicians with a twitter-account than the few ones listed so far&#8230;</p>
<p>Even more convenient is their <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/bydate">list of latest posts</a> from their collection, ordered by date. I&#8217;ve put that page in my Bookmarks Bar the moment I discovered it! It would be nice, if they could provide an RSS-feed of this list, so that people could place it in their sidebar, replacing old-fashioned and useless blogrolls. The site does provide two feeds, but they are completely useless as they click through to empty pages&#8230;</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of math-blogging, the results of the &#8216;What should we write about next?&#8217;-poll that ran <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/changes-ahead.html">the previous two days</a> on the entry page. Of all people visiting that page, 2.6% left suggestions.</p>
<p>The vast majority (67%) wants more posts on <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/tag/noncommutative">noncommutative geometry</a>. Most of you are craving for introductions (and motivation) accessible to undergraduates (as &#8216;it&#8217;s hard to find quality, updated information on this&#8217;). In particular, you want posts giving applications in mathematics (especially number theory), or explaining relationships between different approaches. One person knew exactly how I should go about to achieve the hoped-for accessibility : &#8220;As a rule, I&#8217;d take what you think would be just right for undergrads, and then trim it down a little more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others want rather specialized posts, such as on &#8216;connection and parallel transport in noncommutative geometry&#8217; or on &#8216;trees (per J-L. Loday, M. Aguiar, Connes/Kreimer renormalization (aka Butcher group)), or something completely other tree-related&#8217;.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some of you told me it was fine to write about &#8216;combinatorial games and cool nim stuff, finite simple groups, mathematical history, number theory, arithmetic geometry&#8217;, pushed me to go for &#8216;anything monstrous and moonshiney&#8217; (as if I would know the secrets of the &#8216;connection between the Mathieu group M24 and the elliptic genus of K3&#8217;&#8230;) or wrote that &#8216;various algebraic geometry related posts are always welcome: posts like <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/mumfords-treasure-map.html">Mumford&#8217;s treasure map</a>&#8216;.</p>
