										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Sometimes ideas, like men, jump up and say &#8216;hello&#8217;. They introduce themselves, these ideas, with words. Are they words? These ideas speak so strangely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All that we see in this world is based on someone&#8217;s ideas. Some ideas are destructive, some are constructive. Some ideas can arrive in the form of a dream. I can say it again: some ideas arrive in the form of a dream.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBi2WSlg6ug?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s such an idea.</p>
<p>It all started when Norma wanted to compactify her twisted-prime-fruit pies. Norma&#8217;s pies are legendary in Twin Peaks, but if you never ate them at Double R Diner, here&#8217;s the concept.</p>
<p>Start with a long rectangular strip of pastry and decorate it vertically with ribbons of fruit, one fruit per prime, say cherry for 2, huckleberry for 3, and so on.</p>
<p>For elegance, I argued, the $p$-th ribbon should have width $log(p)$.</p>
<p>&#8220;That may very well look natural to you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but our Geometer disagrees&#8221;. It seems that geometers don&#8217;t like logs.</p>
<p>Whatever. I won.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Norma&#8217;s basic pie, or the $1$-pie as we call it. Next, she performs $n$ strange twists in one direction and $m$ magical operations in another, to get one of her twisted-pies. In this case we would order it as her $\frac{m}{n}$-pie.</p>
<p>Marketing-wise, these pies are problematic. They are infinite in length, so Norma can serve only a finite portion, limiting the number of fruits you can taste.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Norma wants to compactify her pies, so that you can hold the entire pastry in your hands, and taste the infinite richness of our local fruits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221;, our Geometer warned, &#8220;You can never close them up with ordinary scheme-dough, the laws of scheme-pastry prohibit this!&#8221; He suggested to use a ribbon of marzipan, instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine, then&#8230; Margaret, before you start complaining again, how much marzipan should I use?&#8221;, Norma asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;ideally you&#8217;d want it to have zero width, but that wouldn&#8217;t close anything. So, I&#8217;d go for the next best thing, the log being zero. Take a marzipan-ribbon of width $1$.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Geometer took a $1$-pie, closed it with marzipan of width $1$, looked at the pastry from every possible angle, and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a perfectly reasonable trivial bundle, or structure sheaf if you want. I&#8217;d sell it as $\mathcal{O}_{\overline{\mathbf{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})}}$ if I were you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In your dreams!  I&#8217;ll simply call this  a $1$-pastry, and an $\frac{m}{n}$-pie closed with a $1$-ribbon of marzipan can be ordered from now on as an $\frac{m}{n}$-pastry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid this will not suffice,&#8221; our Geometer objected, &#8221; you will have to allow pastries having an arbitrary marzipan-width.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? You want me to compactify an $\frac{m}{n}$-pie  with marzipan of every imaginable width $r$ and produce a whole collection of &#8230; what &#8230; $(\frac{m}{n},r)$-pastries? What on earth for??&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, take an $\frac{m}{n}$-pastry and try to unravel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, here we go again, I feared.</p>
<p>Whereas Norma&#8217;s pies all looked and tasted quite different to most of us, the Geometer claimed they were all the same, or &#8216;isomorphic&#8217; as he pompously declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just reverse the operations Norma performed and you&#8217;ll end up with a $1$-pie&#8221;, he argued.</p>
<p>So Norma took an arbitrary $\frac{m}{n}$-pastry and did perform the reverse operations, which was a lot more difficult that with pies as now the marzipan-bit produced friction. The end-result was a $1$-pie held together with a marzipan-ribbon of width strictly larger or strictly smaller than $1$, but never gave back the $1$-pastry. Strange!</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides&#8221;, the Geometer added, &#8220;if you take two of your pastries, which I prefer to call $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{M}$, rather than use your numerical system, then their product $\mathcal{L} \otimes \mathcal{M}$ is again a pastry, though with variable marzipan-width.</p>
<p>In the promotional stage it might be nice to give the product for free to anyone ordering two pastries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how should I produce such a product-pastry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m too lazy to compute such things, it must follow trivially from elementary results in Picard-pastry. Surely, our log lady will work out the details in your notation. No doubt it will involve lots of logs&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>And so I did the calculations in my dreams, and I wrote down all formulas in the Double R Diner log-book, for Norma to consult whenever a customer ordered a product, or power of pastries.</p>
<p>A few years ago we had a Japanese tourist visiting Twin Peaks. He set up office in the Double R Diner, consulted my formulas, observed Norma&#8217;s pastry production and had endless conversations with our Geometer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m told he categorified Norma&#8217;s pastry-bizness, probably to clone the concept to the Japanese market, replacing pastries by sushi-rolls.</p>
<p>When he left, he thanked me for working out the most trivial of examples, that of the Frobenioid of $\mathbb{Z}$&#8230;</p>

<p>I wrote this little story some time ago.</p>
<p>The last couple of days this blog gets some renewed interest in the aftermath of the <a href="http://www.claymath.org/events/iut-theory-shinichi-mochizuki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IUTT-Mochizuki-Fest in Oxford</a> last week.</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to include it, if only in order to decrease the bounce rate.</p>
<p>If you are at all interested in the maths, you may want to start with <a href="https://plus.google.com/+lievenlebruyn/posts/hK66h2artZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this google+ post</a>, and work your way back using the links curated by David Roberts <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/a/195553/2275" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
