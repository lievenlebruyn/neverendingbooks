										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than ten years ago, when I ran a series of posts on pre-WW2 Bourbaki congresses, I knew most of the existing <a href="https://iecl.univ-lorraine.fr/files/2021/04/Liliane_beaulieu_biblio_bourbaki_20210427.pdf">B-literature</a>. I&#8217;m afraid I forgot most of it, thereby missing opportunities to spice up a dull post (such as <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/from-weils-foundations-to-schemes">yesterday&#8217;s</a>).</p>
<p>Right now, I need facts about the infamous ACNB and its former connection to Nancy, so I reread Liliane Beaulieu&#8217;s <a href="https://docplayer.fr/86142727-Bourbaki-a-nancy-par-liliane-beaulieu.html">Bourbaki a Nancy</a>:</p>
<p>(page 38) : &#8220;Like a theatrical canvas, &#8220;La Tribu&#8221; often carries as its header a subtitle, the product of its editor&#8217;s imagination, which brings out the theme of the congress, if necessary. There is thus a &#8220;De Nicolaıdes&#8221; congress in Nancy, <strong>&#8220;Du banc public&#8221; (reference to Brassens)</strong> that of the &#8220;Universites cogerees&#8221; (in October 68, at the time of co-management).&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-la-ciotat-2">first La Ciotat congress</a> (February 27 to March 6, 1955) was called &#8216;the congress of the public bench&#8217; (&#8216;banc public&#8217; in French) where Serre and Cartan tried to press Bourbaki to opt for the by now standard approach to varieties (see yesterday), and the following Chicago-congress retaliated by saying that there were also public benches nearby, but of little use.</p>
<p>What I missed was the reference to French singer-songwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Brassens">George Brassens</a>. In 1953, he wrote, composed and performed <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Amoureux_des_bancs_publics">Bancs Public</a> (later called &#8216;Les Amoureux des bancs publics&#8217;).</p>

<p>If you need further evidence (me, I&#8217;ll take Liliane&#8217;s word on anything B-related), here&#8217;s the refrain of the song:</p>
<p>&#8220;Les amoureux qui s&#8217;bécotent sur les bancs publics,<br />
Bancs publics, bancs publics,<br />
En s&#8217;foutant pas mal du regard oblique<br />
Des passants honnêtes,<br />
Les amoureux qui s&#8217;bécotent sur les bancs publics,<br />
Bancs publics, bancs publics,<br />
En s&#8217;disant des &#8220;Je t&#8217;aime'&#8221; pathétiques,<br />
<strong>Ont des p&#8217;tits gueules bien sympathiques!</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>(G-translated as:<br />
&#8216;Lovers who smooch on public benches,<br />
Public benches, public benches,<br />
By not giving a damn about the sideways gaze<br />
Honest passers-by,<br />
The lovers who smooch on the public benches,<br />
Public benches, public benches,<br />
Saying pathetic &#8220;I love you&#8221; to each other,<br />
<strong>Have very nice little faces!</strong>&#8216;)</p>
<p>Compare this to page 3 of the corresponding &#8220;La Tribu&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;Geometrie Algebrique : elle a une guele bien sympathique.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Algebraic Geometry : she has a very nice face)</p>
<p><strong>More Bourbaki congresses got their names rather timely. </strong></p>
<p>In the summer of 1959 (from June 25th &#8211; July 8th) there was a congress in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-pelvoux">Pelvout-le-Poet</a> called &#8216;Congres du cerceau&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>&#8216;Cerceau&#8217; is French for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_hoop">Hula Hoop</a>, whose new plastic version was popularized in 1958 by the Wham-O toy company and became a fad.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Girl_twirling_Hula_Hoop%2C_1958.jpg" width=100% ><br />
(Girl twirling Hula Hoop in 1958 &#8211; Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The next summer it was the thing to carry along for children on vacation. From the corresponding &#8220;La Tribu&#8221; (page 2):</p>
<p>&#8220;Le congres fut marque par la presence de nombreux enfants. Les distractions s’en ressentirent : baby-foot, biberon de l’adjudant (tres concurrence par le pastis), jeu de binette et du cerceau (ou faut-il dire ‘binette se jouant du cerceau’?) ; un bal mythique a Vallouise faillit faire passer la mesure.&#8221;<br />
(try to G-translate it yourself&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s another example.</strong></p>
<p>The spring 1949 congress (from April 13th-25th) was held at the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-royaumont">Abbey of Royaumont</a> and was called &#8216;le congres du cocotier&#8217; (the coconut-tree congress).</p>
<p>From the corresponding &#8220;La Tribu 18&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;Having absorbed a tough guinea pig, Bourbaki climbed to the top of the Royaumont coconut tree, and declared, to unanimous applause, that he would only rectify rectifiable curves, that he would treat rational mechanics over the field $\mathbb{Q}$, and, that with a little bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaseline">vaseline</a> and a lot of patience he would end up writing the book on algebraic topology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guinea pig that congress was none other than Jean-Pierre Serre.</p>
<p>A year later (from April 5th-17th 1950) there was another Royaumont-congress called &#8216;le congres de la revanche du cocotier&#8217; (the congress of the revenge of the coconut-tree).</p>
<p>From the corresponding La Tribu 22:</p>
<p>&#8220;The founding members had decided to take a dazzling revenge on the indiscipline young people; mobilising all the magical secrets unveiled to them by the master, they struck down the young people with various ailments; rare were those strong enough to jump over the streams of Royaumont.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Maurice Mashaal says about this in &#8216;Bourbaki &#8211; a secret society of mathematicians&#8217; (page 113):</p>
<p>&#8220;Another prank among the members was called &#8216;le cocotier&#8217; (the coconut tree). According to Liliane Beaulieu, this was inspired by a Polynesian custom where an old man climbs a palm tree and holds on tightly while someone shakes the trunk. If he manages to hold on, he remains accepted in the social group. Bourbaki translated this custom as the following: some members would set a mathematical trap for the others. If someone fell for it, they would yell out &#8216;cocotier&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>May I be so bold as to suggest that perhaps this sudden interest in Polynesian habits was inspired by the recent release of <a href="https://fr.shopping.rakuten.com/offer/buy/11088367/Gibbings-Robert-L-ile-Aux-Cocotiers-Les-Aventures-De-Deux-Enfants-Dans-Les-Mers-Du-Sud-Traduit-De-L-anglais-Par-Edith-Vincent-Illustrations-De-L-auteur-Livre-ancien.html">L&#8217;ile aux cocotiers</a> (1949), the French translation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gibbings">Robert Gibbing&#8217;s</a> book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43402101-coconut-island">Coconut Island</a>?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-birthplace-of-schemes">Last time</a>, we&#8217;ve seen that the first time &#8216;schemes&#8217; were introduced was in &#8216;La Tribu&#8217; (the internal Bourbaki-account of their congresses) of the May-June 1955 congress in Chicago.</p>
<p>Here, we will focus on the events leading up to that event. If you always thought Grothendieck invented the word &#8216;schemes&#8217;, here&#8217;s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McLarty">Colin McLarty</a> wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;A story says that in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/grothendiecks-cafe">a Paris café</a> around 1955 Grothendieck asked his friends &#8220;what is a scheme?&#8221;. <strong>At the time only an undefined idea of &#8220;schéma&#8221; was current in Paris, meaning more or less whatever would improve on Weil&#8217;s foundations.</strong>&#8221; (McLarty in <a href="https://www.landsburg.com/grothendieck/mclarty1.pdf">The Rising Sea</a>)</p>
<p>What were Weil&#8217;s foundations of algebraic geometry?</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s see how Weil defined an affine variety over a field $k$. First you consider a &#8216;universal field&#8217; $K$ containing $k$, that is, $K$ is an algebraically closed field of infinite transcendence degree over $k$. A point of $n$-dimensional affine space is an $n$-tuple $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n) \in K^n$. For such a point $x$ you consider the field $k(x)$ which is the subfield of $K$ generated by $k$ and the coordinates $x_i$ of $x$.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the field $k(x)$ is the field of fractions of the affine domain $R=k[z_1,\dots,z_n]/I$ where $I$ is the prime ideal of all polynomials $f \in k[z_1,\dots,z_n]$ such that $f(x) = f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=0$.</p>
<p>An affine $k$-variety $V$ is associated to a &#8216;generic point&#8217; $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, meaning that the field $k(x)$ is a &#8216;regular extension&#8217; of $k$ (that is, for all field-extensions $k&#8217;$ of $k$, the tensor product $k(x) \otimes_k k&#8217;$ does not contain zero-divisors.</p>
<p>The points of $V$ are the &#8216;specialisations&#8217; of $x$, that is, all points $y=(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ such that $f(y_1,\dots,y_n)=0$ for all $f \in I$.</p>
<p>Perhaps an example? Let $k = \mathbb{Q}$ and $K=\mathbb{C}$ and take $x=(i,\pi)$ in the affine plane $\mathbb{C}^2$. What is the corresponding prime ideal $I$ of $\mathbb{Q}[z_1,z_2]$? Well, $i$ is a solution to $z_1^2+1=0$ whereas $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, so $I=(z_1^2+1)$ and $R=\mathbb{Q}[z_1,z_2]/I= \mathbb{Q}(i)[z_2]$.</p>
<p>Is $x=(i,\pi)$ a generic point? Well, suppose it were, then the points of the corresponding affine variety $V$ would be all couples $(\pm i, \lambda)$ with $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ which is the union of two lines in $\mathbb{C}^2$. But then $i \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes i$ is a zero-divisor in $\mathbb{Q}(x) \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{Q}(i)$. So no, it is not a generic point over $\mathbb{Q}$ and does not define an affine $\mathbb{Q}$-variety.</p>
<p>If we would have started with $k=\mathbb{Q}(i)$, then $x=(i,\pi)$ is generic and the corresponding affine variety $V$ consists of all points $(i,\lambda) \in \mathbb{C}^2$.</p>
<p>If this is new to you, consider yourself lucky to be young enough to have learned AG from <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf">Fulton&#8217;s Algebraic curves</a>, or <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/aconstant/Alg2/Bib/Hartshorne.pdf">Hartshorne&#8217;s chapter 1</a> if you were that ambitious.</p>
<p>By 1955, Serre had written his <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr/media/jean-pierre-serre/UPL5435398796951750634_Serre_FAC.pdf">FAC</a>, and Bourbaki had developed enough commutative algebra to turn His attention to algebraic geometry.</p>
<p><strong>La Ciotat congress (February 27th &#8211; March 6th, 1955)</strong></p>
<p>With a splendid view on the mediterranean, a small group of Bourbaki members (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a> (then 51), with two of his former Ph.D. students: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Koszul">Jean-Louis Koszul</a> (then 34), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> (then 29, and fresh Fields medaillist), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a> (then 31), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Samuel">Pierre Samuel</a> (then 34), a former student of Zariski&#8217;s) discussed a previous &#8216;Rapport de Geometrie Algebrique'(no. 206) and arrived at some unanimous decisions:</p>
<p>1. Algebraic varieties must be sets of points, which will not change at every moment.<br />
2. One should include &#8216;abstract&#8217; varieties, obtained by gluing (fibres, etc.).<br />
3. All necessary algebra must have been previously proved.<br />
4. The main application of purely algebraic methods being characteristic p, we will hide nothing of the unpleasant phenomena that occur there.</p>
<p><center><br />

(Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, photo by Paul Halmos)<br />
</center></p>
<p>The approach the propose is clearly based on Serre&#8217;s FAC. The points of an affine variety are the maximal ideals of an affine $k$-algebra, this set is equipped with the Zariski topology such that the local rings form a structure sheaf. Abstract varieties are then constructed by gluing these topological spaces and sheaves.</p>
<p>At the insistence of the &#8216;specialistes&#8217; (Serre, and Samuel who had just written his book &#8216;Méthodes d&#8217;algèbre abstraite en géométrie algébrique&#8217;) two additional points are adopted, but with some hesitation. The first being a jibe at Weil:<br />
1. &#8230;The congress, being a little disgusted by the artificiality of the generic point, does not want $K$ to be always of infinite transcendent degree over $k$. It admits that generic points are convenient in certain circumstances, but refuses to see them put to all the sauces: one could speak of a coordinate ring or of a  functionfield without stuffing it by force into $K$.<br />
2. Trying to include the arithmetic case.</p>
<p>The last point was problematic as all their algebras were supposed to be affine over a field $k$, and they wouldn&#8217;t go further than to allow the overfield $K$ to be its algebraic closure. Further, (and this caused a lot of heavy discussions at coming congresses) they allowed their varieties to be reducible.</p>
<p><strong>The Chicago congress (May 30th &#8211; June 2nd 1955)</strong></p>
<p>Apart from Samuel, a different group of Bourbakis gathered for the &#8216;second Caucus des Illinois&#8217; at Eckhart Hall, including three founding members Weil (then 49), Dixmier (then 49) and Chevalley (then 46), and two youngsters, Armand Borel (then 32) and Serge Lang (then 28).</p>
<p>Their reaction to the La Ciotat meeting (the &#8216;congress of the public bench&#8217;) was swift:</p>
<p>(page 1) : &#8220;The caucus discovered a public bench near Eckhart Hall, but didn&#8217;t do much with it.&#8221;<br />
(page 2) : &#8220;The caucus did not judge La Ciotat&#8217;s plan beyond reproach, and proposed a completely different plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>They wanted to include the arithmetic case by defining as affine scheme the set of all prime ideals (or rather, the localisations at these prime ideals) of a finitely generated domain over a Dedekind domain. They continue:</p>
<p>(page 4) : &#8220;The notion of a scheme covers the arithmetic case, and is extracted from the illustrious works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Nagata">Nagata</a>, themselves inspired by the scholarly cogitations of Chevalley. This means that the latter managed to sell all his ideas to the caucus. The Pope of Chicago, very happy to be able to reject very far projective varieties and Chow coordinates, willingly rallied to the suggestions of his illustrious colleague. However, we have not attempted to define varieties in the arithmetic case. Weil&#8217;s principle is that it is unclear what will come out of Nagata&#8217;s tricks, and that the only stable thing in arithmetic theory is reduction modulo $p$ a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goro_Shimura">Shimura</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrary to the decisions of La Ciotat, we do not want to glue reducible stuff, nor call them varieties. … We even decide to limit ourselves to absolutely irreducible varieties, which alone will have the right to the name of varieties.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insistence on absolutely irreducibility is understandable from Weil&#8217;s perspective as only they will have a generic point. But why does he go along with Chevalley&#8217;s proposal of an affine scheme?</p>
<p>In Weil&#8217;s approach, a point of the affine variety $V$ determined by a generic point $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ determines a prime ideal $Q$ of the domain $R=k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, so Chevalley&#8217;s proposal to consider all prime ideals (rather than only the maximal ideals of an affine algebra) seems right to Weil.</p>
<p>However in Weil&#8217;s approach there are usually several points corresponding to the same prime ideal $Q$ of $R$, namely all possible embeddings of the ring $R/Q$ in that huge field $K$, so whenever $R/Q$ is not algebraic over $k$, there are infinitely Weil-points of $V$ corresponding to $Q$ (whence the La Ciotat criticism that points of a variety were not supposed to change at every moment).</p>
<p>According to Ralf Krömer in his book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-7643-7524-9">Tool and Object &#8211; a history and philosophy of category theory</a> this shift from Weil-points to prime ideals of $R$ may explain Chevalley&#8217;s use of the word &#8216;scheme&#8217;:</p>
<p>(page 164) : &#8220;The &#8216;scheme of the variety&#8217; denotes &#8216;what is invariant in a variety&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another time we will see how internal discussion influenced the further Bourbaki congresses until Grothendieck came up with his &#8216;hyperplan&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rereading the <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Letters/GS.pdf">Grothendieck-Serre correspondence</a> I found a letter from Serre to Grothendieck, dated October 22nd 1958, which forces me to retract some claims from the previous <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-la-ciotat">La Ciotat post</a>.</p>
<p>Serre writes this ten days after the second La Ciotat-congress (La Tribu 46), held from October 5th-12th 1958:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bourbaki meeting was very pleasant; we all stayed in the home of a man called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gu%C3%A9rin">Guérin</a> (a friend of Schwartz&#8217;s &#8211; a political one, I think); Guérin himself was in Paris and we had the whole house to ourselves. We worked outside most of the time, the weather was beautiful, we went swimming almost every day; in short, it was one of the best meetings I have ever been to.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far so good, we did indeed find Guérin&#8217;s property ‘Maison Rustique Olivette’ as the location of Bourbaki&#8217;s La Ciotat-congresses. But, Serre was present at both meetings (the earlier one, La Tribu 35, was held from February 27th &#8211; March 6th, 1955), so wouldn&#8217;t he have mentioned that they returned to that home when both meetings took place there?</p>
<p>From La Tribu 35:</p>
<p>“The Congress was held “chez Patrice”, in La Ciotat, from February 27 to March 6, 1955. Present: Cartan, Dixmier, Koszul, Samuel, Serre, le Tableau (property, fortunately divisible, of Bourbaki).&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-la-ciotat">previous post</a> I mentioned that there was indeed a Hotel-Restaurant &#8220;Chez Patrice&#8221; in La Ciotat, but mistakingly assumed both meetings took place at Guérin&#8217;s property.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.delcampe.net/static/img_large/auction/001/224/040/615_001.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>Can we locate this place?</p>
<p>On the backside of this old photograph</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.delcampe.net/static/img_large/auction/001/224/040/615_002.jpg?v=1" width=100% ></p>
<p>we read:</p>
<p>&#8220;Chez Patrice&#8221;<br />
seul au bord de la mer<br />
Hotel Restaurant tout confort<br />
Spécialités Provençales<br />
Plage privée Parc auto<br />
Ouvert toute l&#8217;année<br />
Sur la route de La Ciota-Bandol<br />
Tel 465<br />
La Ciota (B.-d.-R.)</p>
<p>So it must be on the scenic coastal road from La Ciotat to Bandol. My best guess is that &#8220;Chez Patrice&#8221; is today the one Michelin-star Restaurant <a href="https://www.latabledenans.com/">&#8220;La Table de Nans&#8221;</a>, located at 126 Cor du Liouquet, in La Ciotat.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.latabledenans.com/image/gallery/36/image-moyen-la_table_de_nans_102.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>Their website has just this to say about the history of the place:</p>
<p>&#8220;Located in an exceptional setting between La Ciotat and Saint Cyr, the building of &#8220;l&#8217;auberge du Revestel&#8221; was restored in 2016.&#8221;</p>
<p>And a comment on a website dedicated to the nearby <a href="https://restaurants-de-france.fr/05-hautes-alpes/la-ciotat/restaurants/106691-roche-belle.html">Restaurant Roche Belle</a> confirms that &#8220;Chez Patrice&#8221;, &#8220;l&#8217;auberge du Revestel&#8221; and &#8220;table de Nans&#8221; were all at the same place:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nous sommes locaux et avons découverts ce restaurant seulement le mois dernier (suite infos copains) alors que j&#8217;ai passé une partie de mon enfance et adolescence &#8220;chez Patrice&#8221; (Revestel puis chez Nans)!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope to have it right this time: the first Bourbaki La Ciotat-meeting in 1955 took place  &#8220;Chez Patrice&#8221; whereas the second 1958-congress was held at ‘Maison Rustique Olivette’, the property of Schwartz&#8217;s friend Daniel Guérin.</p>
<p>Still, if you compare Serre&#8217;s letter to this paragraph from Schwartz&#8217;s autobiography, there&#8217;s something odd:</p>
<p>“I knew Daniel Guérin very well until his death. Anarchist, close to Trotskyism, he later joined Marceau Prevert’s PSOP. He had the kindness, after the war, to welcome in his property near La Ciotat one of the congresses of the Bourbaki group. He shared, in complete camaraderie, our life and our meals for two weeks. I even went on a moth hunt at his house and caught a death’s-head hawk-moth (Acherontia atropos).”</p>
<p>Schwartz was not present at the second La Ciotat-meeting, and he claims Guérin shared meals with the Bourbakis whereas Serre says he was in Paris and they had the whole house to themselves.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: accounts right after the event (Serre&#8217;s letter) are more trustworthy than later recollections (Schwartz&#8217;s autobiography).</p>
<p>Dear <a href="https://www.bourbaki.fr/">Collaborators of Nicolas Bourbaki</a>, please make all Bourbaki material (Diktat, La Tribu, versions) publicly available, certainly those documents older than 50 years.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can start by adding the missing numbers 36 and 49 to your <a href="http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/items/browse?search=&#038;advanced[0][joiner]=or&#038;advanced[0][element_id]=38&#038;advanced[0][type]=contains&#038;advanced[0][terms]=1940-1953&#038;advanced[1][joiner]=or&#038;advanced[1][element_id]=38&#038;advanced[1][type]=contains&#038;advanced[1][terms]=1953-1960&#038;range=&#038;collection=&#038;type=&#038;user=&#038;tags=&#038;public=&#038;featured=&#038;geolocation-address=&#038;geolocation-latitude=&#038;geolocation-longitude=&#038;geolocation-radius=&#038;exhibit=&#038;item_relations_property_id=&#038;item_relations_comment=&#038;item_relations_clause_part=all&#038;submit_search=Recherches+de+contenus">La Tribu: 1940-1960</a> list.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The preparations for the unique Bourbaki-congress in Murols, start already in La Tribu 32 (fall 1953). On page 3:</p>
<p>&#8220;Summer 54: To suit Phileas Chevalley, Sammy Fogg and eventual Mexicans and Colombians, this Congress will be held from August 17 to 30. Samuel will look for a hotel in Auvergne, but everyone is asked to also prospect the hotels in his region.&#8221;</p>
<p>One should recall that the ICM 1954 was held in Amsterdam from September 2nd-9th. It was convenient for Chevalley and Eilenberg (who were in the US) and for possible more foreigners to have Bourbaki&#8217;s summer congress just before the ICM.</p>
<p>(Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phileas_Fogg">Phileas Fogg</a> is the main character in Jules Verne&#8217;s Around the World in 80 days.)</p>
<p>A lot of people attended the Murols-meeting (La Tribu 34, &#8216;Congres super-oecumenique du frigidaire et des revetements troues&#8217;).</p>
<p>Apart from the regular crowd (Cartan, Chevalley, Delsarte, Dieudonne, Dixmier, Godement, Koszul, Sammy (=Eilenberg), Samuel, Schwartz, Serre and Weil), there was a guinea-pig (Serge Lang), an &#8216;efficiency expert&#8217; (Saunders MacLane), two &#8216;foreign visitors&#8217; (Hochschild and John Tate) and two &#8216;honorable foreign visitors&#8217; (Iyanaga and Kosaku Yosida).</p>
<p>Probably because of this, extremely detailed travel instructions were given in La Tribu 33 (page 2):</p>
<p>&#8220;Next congress: will be held at the Hotel des Pins, in Murols (Puy-de-Dome) from August 17 to 30.<br />
There is at least one night train departing from Paris, going to Clermont or Issoire, followed by a bus-ride to Murols; details will be given as soon as we know the summer schedules.<br />
For motorized people not coming from the South by the N.9, nor from the West by the N.89: go to Clermont-Ferrand, leave it by the N.9 (route d&#8217;Issoire), turn right about 17 kms further (after the village of Veyre) to take the N.678 towards Champeix; in Champeix take (on the right) the N.496 (direction of St-Nectaire, Murols and Mont-Dore).<br />
For those coming from the South by the N.9: turn left at Issoire to take the N.496 towards Campais, St-Nectaire, Murols. For those coming from the West by the N.89: leave it a little before Lequeille to take (on the right) the N.122, turn left 2 km further to take the N.496 towards Mont-Dore, the Chambon lake and Murols (road continuing towards Champeix and Issoire).&#8221;</p>
<p>If you follow this route on the map, you&#8217;ll know that the congress was not held in <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murols">Murols</a> (departement de l&#8217;Aveyron), but in <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murol">Murol</a> (departement du Puy-de-Dome).</p>
<p>This time we do not have to search long for the place of venue as <a href="https://www.hoteldespins-murol.com/fr/">Hotel des Pins a Murol</a> is still in operation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.hoteldespins-murol.com/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/7a/9f/7a9f74d8-c5c6-442e-98cb-bb3fa4123a19/hotel-des-pins-79.jpg__1920x1080_q85_crop_subsampling-2_upscale.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>Note the terras on the first floor, and the impressive line of trees in front of the hotel.</p>
<p>At first I felt frustrated as I couldn&#8217;t figure out where this well-known photograph of the Murol-meeting was taken.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2020/11/Boubaki-2000_balcony.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>From left to right, Godement, Dieudonne, Weil, MacLane, and a smug looking Serre (he knew he would be awarded a Fields medal in a few days time).</p>
<p>Today it is impossible to have this view from the hotel-terras because of the trees in front. Still, the picture was taken from the terras, and the imposing building in the background is the late <a href="http://abandoned-france.org/history-murol-abandoned-hotel.php">Turing Hotel in Murol</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of it with the Hotel des Pins in the background.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://abandoned-france.org/gallery/albums/Murol_Abandoned_Hotel/07.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve encountered the Murol-congress before on this blog when trying to piece together <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-lemme-de-la-gare-du-nord">the history of the Yoneda lemma</a> (Iyanaga was Yoneda&#8217;s Ph.D. advisor, and probably on his advice MacLane met with Yoneda in the Gare du Nord to hear about his lemma).</p>
<p>On MacLane&#8217;s role as &#8216;efficiency expert&#8217; we have this in La Tribu 34:</p>
<p>&#8220;Frightened by the disorder of the discussions, some members had brought a world-renowned efficiency expert from Chicago. This one, armed with a hammer, tried hard and with good humor,  but without much result. He quickly realized that it was useless, and turned, successfully this time, to photography.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-amboise">Amboise</a> and <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-pelvoux">Pelvoux</a>, Bourbaki likes to have His summer venues close to places of great sentimental value.</p>
<p>Murol is very close to Besse-et-Saint Anastaise, the place of the very <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/where-is-the-royal-poldavian-academy">first Bourbaki-meeting in 1935</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/murols23.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>As always, this asks for a little pilgrimage. From La Tribu 34 (page 2):</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the incessant rain, Bourbaki was attracted by the waters, and went to explore lots of Auvergnian lakes. Besse and its Lac Pavin were naturally entitled to a pilgrimage. Courageous founding-fathers and lower-members, braving the rain and fog, rushed across to the lake of Guery where their dripping pants aroused the suspicions of a bar maid, and beat the motorized elements there by several lengths. Others swam and rowed. Even the Japanese were entitled to their lake.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been many, many years since I&#8217;ve last visited the Bourbaki Archives.</p>
<p>The underground repository of the Bourbaki Secret Archives is a storage facility built beneath the cave of the former <a href="https://parallelespotentiels.blog/2021/05/07/avatars-dun-cafe-parisien-le-capoulade-au-pantheon/">Capoulade Cafe</a>. Given its sporadic use by staff and scholars, the entire space &#8211; including the Gallery of all intermediate versions of every damned Bourbaki book, the section reserved to Bourbaki&#8217;s internal notes, such as his <a href="http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/feuilleter.php?chap=1.2.3">Diktats</a>, and all numbers of <a href="http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/feuilleter.php?chap=1.2.1">La Tribu</a>, and the Miscellania, containing personal notes and other prullaria once belonging to its members &#8211; is illuminated by amber lighting activated only when movement is detected by strategically placed sensors, and is guarded by a private security firm, hired by the <a href="https://www.bourbaki.fr/">ACNB</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.italywithclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/vatican-secret-collection.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>This description (based on that of the Vatican Secret Archives in the book The Magdalene Reliquary by Gary McAvoy) is far from the actual situation. The Bourbaki Archive has been pieced together from legates donated by some of its former members (including Delsarte, Weil, de Possel, Cartan, Samuel, and others), and consist of well over a hundredth labeled carton and plastic cases, fitting easily in a few standard white Billy Ikea bookcases.</p>
<p>The publicly available Bourbaki Archive is even much smaller. The <a href="https://www.bourbaki.fr/">Association des collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki</a> has strong opinions on which items can be put online. For years the available issues of La Tribu were restricted to <a href="http://sites.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/feuilleter.php?chap=1.2.1">those before 1953</a>. I was once told that one of the second generation Bourbaki-members vetoed further releases.</p>
<p>As a result, we only had the fading (and often coloured) memories of Bourbaki-members to rely on if we wanted to reconstruct key events, for example, Bourbaki&#8217;s reluctance to include category theory in its works. Rather than to work on source material, we had to content ourselves with interviews, such as this one, the relevant part starts at 51.40 into the clip. See <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-and-grothendieck-serre">here</a> for some other interesting time-slots.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqR459KxDVU?start=3100" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>On a recent visit to the <a href="http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/">Bourbaki Archives</a> I was happy to see that all volumes of &#8220;La Tribu&#8221; (the internal newsletter of Bourbaki) are now <a href="http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/items/browse?search=&#038;advanced[0][joiner]=or&#038;advanced[0][element_id]=38&#038;advanced[0][type]=contains&#038;advanced[0][terms]=1940-1953&#038;advanced[1][joiner]=or&#038;advanced[1][element_id]=38&#038;advanced[1][type]=contains&#038;advanced[1][terms]=1953-1960&#038;range=&#038;collection=&#038;type=&#038;user=&#038;tags=&#038;public=&#038;featured=&#038;geolocation-address=&#038;geolocation-latitude=&#038;geolocation-longitude=&#038;geolocation-radius=&#038;exhibit=&#038;item_relations_property_id=&#038;item_relations_comment=&#038;item_relations_clause_part=all&#038;submit_search=Recherches+de+contenus">online from 1940 until 1960</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not the entire story yet but, for all you Grothendieck aficionados out there, it should be enough as G resigned from Bourbaki in 1960 with <a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/LGB91060.pdf">this letter</a> (see <a href="https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/LGB91060en.pdf">here</a> for a translation).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Gresigning.png" width=100% ></p>
<p>Grothendieck was present at just <a href="http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/items/browse?advanced[0][element_id]=87&#038;advanced[0][type]=is+exactly&#038;advanced[0][terms]=Grothendieck%2C+Alexandre">twelve Bourbaki congresses</a> in the period between 1955 and 1960 (he was also present as a &#8216;cobaye&#8217; at a 1951 congress in Nancy).</p>
<p>The period 1955-60 was crucial in the modern development of algebraic geometry. <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr/media/jean-pierre-serre/UPL5435398796951750634_Serre_FAC.pdf">Serre&#8217;s &#8216;FAC&#8217;</a> was published, as was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck%27s_T%C3%B4hoku_paper">Grothendieck&#8217;s &#8216;Tohoku-paper&#8217;</a>, there was the influential <a href="http://www.numdam.org/actas/SCC/">Chevalley seminar</a>, and the internal Bourbaki-fight about categories and the functorial view.</p>
<p>Perhaps the definite paper on the later issue is Ralf Kromer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.numdam.org/article/RHM_2006__12_1_119_0.pdf">La &#8216;Machine de Grothendieck&#8217; se fonde-t-elle seulement sur les vocables metamathematiques? Bourbaki et les categories au cours des annees cinquante</a>.</p>
<p>Kromer had access to most issues of La Tribu until 1962 (from the Delsarte archive in Nancy), but still felt the need to justify his use of these sources to the ACNB (footnote 9 of his paper):</p>
<p>&#8220;L’autorisation que j’ai obtenue par le Comité scientifique des Archives de la création des mathématiques, unité du CNRS qui fut chargée jusqu’en 2003 de la mise à disposition de ces archives, me donne également le droit d’utiliser les sources datant des années postérieures à l’année 1953, que j’avais consultées auparavant aux Archives Jean Delsarte, soit avant que l’ACNB (Association des Collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki) ne rende publique sa décision d’ouvrir ses archives et ne décide des parties qui seraient consultables.</p>
<p>J’ai ainsi bénéficié d’une occasion qui ne se présenterait sans doute plus aujourd’hui, mais c’est en toute légitimité que je puis m’appuyer sur cette riche documentation. Toutefois, la collection des Archives Jean Delsarte étant à son tour limitée aux années antérieures à 1963, je n’ai pu étudier la discussion ultérieure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Association des Collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki made retirement from active B-membership mandatory at the age of 50. One might expect of it to open up all documents in its archives which are older than fifty years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we&#8217;ll have a go at the 1940-1960 issues of La Tribu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time of year I&#8217;m usually in France, or at least I was before Covid. This might explain for my recent obsession with French math YouTube interviews.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s first one is about Bourbaki&#8217;s golden years, the period between WW2 and 1975. Alain Connes is trying to get some anecdotes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Cartier_(mathematician)">Pierre Cartier</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have the time to sit through the whole thing, perhaps you might have a look at the discussion on whether or not to include categories in Bourbaki (starting at 51.40 into the clip).</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqR459KxDVU?start=3100" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here are some other time-slots (typed on a qwerty keyboard, mes excuses) with some links.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of the day the notion of &#8216;neighbourhood&#8217; changed forever (at least in the geometric sense).</p>
<p>For ages a neighbourhood of a point was understood to be an open set of the topology containing that point. But on that day, it was demonstrated that the topology of choice of algebraic geometry, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zariski_topology">Zariski topology</a>, needed a drastic upgrade.</p>
<p>This ultimately led to the totally new notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_topology">Grothendieck topologies</a>, which aren&#8217;t topological spaces at all.</p>
<p>Formally, the definition of Grothendieck topologies was cooked up in the fall of 1961 when Grothendieck visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Zariski">Zariski</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Artin">Mike Artin</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mumford">David Mumford</a> in Harvard.</p>
<p>The following spring, Mike Artin ran a seminar resulting in his lecture notes on, yes, <a href="http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~larsh/teaching/S2013_AG/grothendiecktopologies.pdf">Grothendieck topologies</a>.</p>
<p>But, paradigm shifts like this need a spark, &#8216;une bougie d&#8217;allumage&#8217;, and that moment of insight happened quite a few years earlier.</p>
<p>It was a sunny spring monday afternoon at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Normale_Sup%C3%A9rieure">Ecole Normal Superieure</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> was giving the first lecture in the 1958 <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/browse?id=SCC_1958__3_">Seminaire Claude Chevalley</a> which that year had Chow rings as its topic.</p>
<p>That day, april 21st 1958, Serre was lecturing on <a href="http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/SCC/SCC_1958__3_/SCC_1958__3__A1_0/SCC_1958__3__A1_0.pdf">algebraic fibre bundles</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="" src="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/SerreFibres.jpg" /></p>
<p>He had run into a problem.</p>
<p>If a Lie group $G$ acts freely on a manifold $M$, then the set of $G$-orbits $M/G$ is again a manifold and the quotient map $\pi : M \rightarrow M/G$ is a principal $G$-fibre bundle meaning that for sufficiently small open sets $U$ of $M/G$ we have diffeomorphisms</p>
<p>$\pi^{-1}(U) \simeq U \times G$</p>
<p>that is, locally (but not globally) $M$ is just a product manifold of $G$ with another manifold and the $G$-orbits are all of the form $\{ u \} \times G$.</p>
<p>The corresponding situation in algebraic geometry would be this: a nice, say reductive, algebraic group $G$ acting freely on a nice, say smooth, algebraic variety $X$. In this case one can form again an orbit space $X/G$ which is again a (smooth) algebraic variety but the natural quotient map $\pi : X \rightarrow X/G$ rarely has this local product property&#8230;</p>
<p>The reason being that the Zariski topology on $X/G$ is way too coarse, it doesn&#8217;t have enough open sets to enforce this local product property.</p>
<p>(For algebraists: let $A$ be an Azumaya algebra of rank $n^2$ over $\mathbb{C}[X]$, then the representation variety $\mathbf{rep}_n(A)$ is a principal $\mathbf{PGL}_n$-bundle over $X$ but is only local trivial in the Zariski topology when $A$ is a trivial Azumaya algebra, that is, $End_{\mathbb{C}[X]}(P)$ for a rank $n$ projective module $P$ over $\mathbb{C}[X]$.)</p>
<p>But, Serre had come up with a solution.</p>
<p>He was going to study fibre bundles which were locally &#8216;isotrivial&#8217;, meaning that they had the required local product property but only after extending them over an unamified cover $Y \rightarrow X$ (what we now call, an etale cover) and he was able to clasify such fibre bundles by a laborious way (which we now call the first etale cohomology group).</p>
<p>The story goes that Grothendieck, sitting in the public, immediately saw that these etale extensions were the correct generalization of the usual (Zariski) localizations and that he could develop a cohomology theory out of them in all dimensions.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/mclarty1.pdf">Colin McLarty</a> Serre was &#8216;absolutely unconvinced&#8217;, since he felt he had &#8216;brutally forced&#8217; the bundles to yield the $H^1$&#8217;s.</p>
<p>We will never known what Serre actually wrote on the blackboard on april 21st 1958.</p>
<p>The above scanned image tells it is an expanded version of the original talk, written up several months later after the ICM-talk by Grothendieck in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>By that time, Grothendieck had shown Serre that his method indeed gives cohomology in all dimensions,and convinced him that this etale cohomology was likely to be the &#8220;true cohomology needed to prove the Weil conjectures&#8221;.</p>
