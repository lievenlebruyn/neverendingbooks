										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sunday, January 28th 1940, Hamburg</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Witt">Ernst Witt</a> wants to get two papers out of his system because he knows he&#8217;ll have to enter the Wehrmacht in February.</p>
<p>The first one, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Spiegelungsgruppen-und-Aufz%C3%A4hlung-halbeinfacher-Witt/165e95a3eabc637a3d0a8c909d02a7f38f52a333">&#8220;Spiegelungsgruppen und Aufzählung halbeinfacher Liescher Ringe&#8221;</a>, contains his own treatment of the root systems of semisimple Lie algebras and their reflexion groups, following up on previous work by Killing, Cartan, Weyl, van der Waerden and Coxeter.</p>
<p><center><br />

<p>Important for our story is that this paper contains the result stating that integral lattices generated by norm 2 elements are direct sums of root systems of the simply laced Dynkin diagrans $A_n, D_n$ and $E_6,E_7$ or $E_8$ (Witt uses a slightly different notation).</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/DynkinDiagrams.jpg" width=50% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>In each case, Witt knows of course the number of roots and the determinant of the Gram matrix<br />
\[<br />
\begin{array}{c|cc}<br />
&#038; \# \text{roots} &#038; \text{determinant} \\<br />
\hline<br />
A_n &#038; n^2+n &#038; n+1 \\<br />
D_n &#038; 2n^2-2n &#038; 4 \\<br />
E_6 &#038; 72 &#038; 3 \\<br />
E_7 &#038; 126 &#038; 2 \\<br />
E_8 &#038; 240 &#038; 1<br />
\end{array}<br />
\]<br />
The second paper <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Eine-Identit%C3%A4t-zwischen-Modulformen-zweiten-Grades-Witt/ff9a4e216014bf433dc870eebf07baf6d9630a7c">&#8220;Eine Identität zwischen Modulformen zweiten Grades&#8221;</a> proves that there are just two positive definite even unimodular lattices (those in which every squared length is even, and which have one point per unit volume, that is, have determinant one) in dimension sixteen, $E_8 \oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$. Previously, <a href=":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_J._Mordell">Louis Mordell</a> showed that the only unimodular even lattice in dimension $8$ is $E_8$.</p>
<p>The connection with modular forms is via their theta series, listing the number of lattice points of each squared length<br />
\[<br />
\theta_L(q) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \#\{ \lambda \in L : (\lambda,\lambda)=m \} q^{m} \]<br />
which is a modular form of weight $n/2$ ($n$ being the dimension which must be divisible by $8$) in case $L$ is a positive definitive even unimodular lattice.</p>
<p>The algebra of all modular forms is generated by the Eisenstein series $E_2$ and $E_3$ of weights $4$ and $6$, so in dimension $8$ we have just one possible theta series<br />
\[<br />
\theta_L(q) = E_2^2 = 1+480 q^2+ 61920 q^4+ 1050240 q^6+ \dots \]</p>
<p>It is interesting to read Witt&#8217;s proof of his main result (Satz 3) in which he explains how he constructed the possible even unimodular lattices in dimension $16$.</p>
<p>He knows that the sublattice of $L$ generated by the $480$ norm two elements must be a direct sum of root lattices. His knowledge of the number of roots in each case tells him there are only two possibilities<br />
\[<br />
E_8 \oplus E_8 \qquad \text{and} \qquad D_{16} \]<br />
The determinant of the Gram matrix of $E_8 \oplus E_8$ is one, so this one is already unimodular. The remaining possibility<br />
\[<br />
D_{16} = \{ (x_1,\dots,x_{16}) \in \mathbb{Z}^{16}~|~x_1+ \dots + x_{16} \in 2 \mathbb{Z} \} \]<br />
has determinant $4$ so he needs to add further lattice points (necessarily contained in the dual lattice $D_{16}^*$) to get it unimodular. He knows the coset representatives of $D_{16}^*/D_{16}$:<br />
\[<br />
\begin{cases}<br />
[0]=(0, \dots,0) &#038;~\text{of norm $0$} \\<br />
[1]=(\tfrac{1}{2},\dots,\tfrac{1}{2}) &#038;~\text{of norm $4$} \\<br />
[2]=(0,\dots,0,1) &#038;~\text{of norm $1$} \\<br />
[3]=(\tfrac{1}{2},\dots,\tfrac{1}{2},-\tfrac{1}{2}) &#038;~\text{of norm $4$}<br />
\end{cases}<br />
\]<br />
and he verifies that the determinant of $D_{16}^+=D_{16}+([1]+D_{16})$ is indeed one (btw. adding coset $[3]$ gives an isomorphic lattice). Witt calls this procedure to arrive at the correct lattices forced (&#8216;zwangslaufig&#8217;).</p>
<p>So, how do you think Witt would go about finding even unimodular lattices in dimension $24$?</p>
<p>To me it is clear that he would start with a direct sum of root lattices whose dimensions add up to $24$, compute the determinant of the Gram matrix and, if necessary, add coset classes to arrive at a unimodular lattice.</p>
<p>Today we would call this procedure &#8216;adding glue&#8217;, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kneser">Martin Kneser</a>, who formalised this procedure in 1967.</p>
<p>On January 28th 1940, Witt writes that he found more than $10$ different classes of even unimodular lattices in dimension $24$ (without giving any details) and mentioned that the determination of the total number of such lattices will not be entirely trivial (&#8216;scheint nicht ganz leicht zu sein&#8217;).</p>
<p>The complete classification of all $24$ even unimodular lattices in dimension $24$ was achieved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Volker_Niemeier">Hans Volker Niemeier</a> in his <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=57076">1968 Ph.D. thesis</a> &#8220;Definite quadratische Formen der Dimension 24 und Diskriminante 1&#8221;, under the direction of Martin Kneser. Naturally, these lattices are now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niemeier_lattice">Niemeier lattices</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Which of the Niemeier lattices were known to Witt in 1940?</strong></p>
<p>There are three obvious certainties: $E_8 \oplus E_8 \oplus E_8$, $E_8 \oplus D_{16}^+$ (both already unimodular, the second by Witt&#8217;s work) and $D_{24}^+$ with a construction analogous to the one of $D_{16}^+$.</p>
<p>To make an educated guess about the remaining Witt-Niemeier lattices we can do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>use our knowledge of Niemeier lattices to figure out which of these Witt was most likely to stumble upon, and</li>
<li>imagine how he would adapt his modular form approach in dimension $16$ to dimension $24$.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s Kneser&#8217;s neighbourhood graph of the Niemeier lattices. Its vertices are the $24$ Niemeiers and there&#8217;s an edge between $L$ and $M$ whenever the intersection $L \cap M$ is of index $2$ in both $L$ and $M$. In this case, $L$ and $M$ are called neighbours.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Neighborhood_graph_of_Niemeier_lattices.svg/1080px-Neighborhood_graph_of_Niemeier_lattices.svg.png" width=60% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>Although the theory of neighbours was not known to Witt, the graph may give an indication of how likely it is to dig up a new Niemeier lattice by poking into an already discovered one.<br />
The three certainties are the three lattices at the bottom of the neighborhood graph, making it more likely for the lattices in the lower region to be among Witt&#8217;s list.</p>
<p>For the other approach, the space of modular forms of weight $12$ is two dimensional, with a basis formed by the series<br />
\[<br />
\begin{cases}<br />
E_6(q) = 1 + \tfrac{65520}{691}(q+2049 q^2 + 177148 q^3+4196353q^4+\dots \\<br />
\Delta(q) = q-24 q^2+252q^3-1472q^4+ \dots<br />
\end{cases}<br />
 \]</p>
<p>If you are at all with me, Witt would start with a lattice $R$ which is a direct sum of root lattices, so he would know the number of its roots (the norm $2$ vectors in $R$), let&#8217;s call this number $r$. Now, he wants to construct an even unimodular lattice $L$ containing $R$, so the theta series of both $L$ and $R$ must start off with $1 + r q^2 + \dots$. But, then he knows<br />
\[<br />
\theta_L(q) = E_6(q) + (r-\frac{65520}{691})\Delta(q) \]<br />
and comparing coefficients of $\theta_L(q)$ with those of $\theta_R(q)$ will give him an idea what extra vectors he has to throw in.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re generous to Witt (and frankly, why shouldn&#8217;t we), we may believe that he used his vast knowledge of Steiner systems (a few years earlier he wrote the definite paper on the Mathieu groups, and a paper on Steiner systems) to construct in this way the lattices $(A_1^{24})^+$ and $(A_2^{12})^+$.</p>
<p>The &#8216;glue&#8217; for $(A_1^{24})^+$ is coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code#:~:text=The%20extended%20binary%20Golay%20code,bit%20errors%20can%20be%20detected.">extended binary Golay code</a>, which itself uses the Steiner system $S(5,8,24)$. $(A_2^{12})^+$ is constructed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_Golay_code#:~:text=The%20extended%20ternary%20Golay%20code,as%20the%20ternary%20Golay%20code.">extended ternary Golay code</a>, based on the Steiner system $S(5,6,12)$.</p>
<p>The one thing that would never have crossed his mind that sunday in 1940 was to explore the possibility of an even unimodular 24-dimensional lattice $\Lambda$ without any roots!</p>
<p>One with $r=0$, and thus with a theta series starting off as<br />
\[<br />
\theta_{\Lambda}(q) = 1 + 196560 q^4 + 16773120 q^6 + \dots \]<br />
No, he did <strong>not</strong> find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice">Leech lattice</a> that day.</p>
<p>If he would have stumbled upon it, it would have simply blown his mind.</p>
<p>It would have been so much against all his experiences and intuitions that he would have dropped everything on the spot to write a paper about it, or at least, he would have mentioned in his &#8216;more than $10$ lattices&#8217;-claim that, surprisingly, one of them was an even unimodular lattice without any roots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever I visit someone&#8217;s YouTube or Twitter profile page, I hope to see an interesting banner image. Here&#8217;s the one from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIyDqfi_cbkp-RU20aBF-MQ">Richard Borcherds&#8217; YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BorcherdsNumbers.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>Not too surprisingly for Borcherds, almost all of these numbers are related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group">monster group</a> or its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine">moonshine</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try to decode them, in no particular order.</p>
<p><strong>196884</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McKay_(mathematician)">John McKay&#8217;s</a> observation $196884 = 1 + 196883$ was the start of the whole &#8216;monstrous moonshine&#8217; industry. Here, $1$ and $196883$ are the dimensions of the two smallest irreducible representations of the monster simple group, and $196884$ is the first non-trivial coefficient in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-invariant">Klein&#8217;s j-function</a> in number theory.</p>
<p>$196884$ is also the dimension of the space in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griess">Robert Griess</a> constructed the Monster, following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_P._Norton">Simon Norton&#8217;s</a> lead that there should be an algebra structure on the monster-representation of that dimension. This algebra is now known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griess_algebra">Griess algebra</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recent talk by Griess <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zynb7VKRr-U">&#8220;My life and times with the sporadic simple groups&#8221;</a> in which he tells about his construction of the monster (relevant part starting at 1:15:53 into the movie).</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zynb7VKRr-U?start=4553" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>1729</strong></p>
<p>1729 is the second (and most famous) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_number">taxicab number</a>. A long time ago I did write a post about the classic Ramanujan-Hardy story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Ono">the taxicab curve</a> (note to self: try to tidy up the layout of some old posts!).</p>
<p>Recently, connections between Ramanujan&#8217;s observation and K3-surfaces were discovered. Emory University has an enticing press release about this: <a href="http://esciencecommons.blogspot.com/2015/10/mathematicians-find-magic-key-to-drive.html">Mathematicians find &#8216;magic key&#8217; to drive Ramanujan&#8217;s taxi-cab number</a>. The paper itself is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00735">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve found that Ramanujan actually discovered a K3 surface more than 30 years before others started studying K3 surfaces and they were even named. It turns out that Ramanujan’s work anticipated deep structures that have become fundamental objects in arithmetic geometry, number theory and physics.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Ono">Ken Ono</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>24</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no other number like $24$ responsible for the existence of sporadic simple groups.</p>
<p>24 is the length of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20and%20electronics%20engineering,finite%20sporadic%20groups%20in%20mathematics.">binary Golay code</a>, with isomorphism group the sporadic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_group">Mathieu group</a> $M_24$ and hence all of the other Mathieu-groups as subgroups.</p>
<p>24 is the dimension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice">Leech lattice</a>, with isomorphism group the Conway group $Co_0 = .0$ (dotto), giving us modulo its center the sporadic group $Co_1=.1$ and the other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_group">Conway groups</a> $Co_2=.2, Co_3=.3$, and all other sporadics of the second generation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pariah_group">happy family</a> as subquotients (McL,HS,Suz and $HJ=J_2$)</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/SporadicGroups.svg/680px-SporadicGroups.svg.png" width=60% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>24 is the central charge of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_vertex_algebra">Monster vertex algebra</a> constructed by Frenkel, Lepowski and Meurman. Most experts believe that the Monster&#8217;s reason of existence is that it is the symmetry group of this vertex algebra. John Conway was one among few others hoping for a nicer explanation, as he said in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbN8EMcOH5o">interview with Alex Ryba</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbN8EMcOH5o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>24 is also an important number in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine">monstrous moonshine</a>, see for example the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-defining-property-of-24">the defining property of 24</a>. There&#8217;s a lot more to say on this, but I&#8217;ll save it for another day.</p>
<p><strong>60</strong></p>
<p>60 is, of course, the order of the smallest non-Abelian simple group, $A_5$, the rotation symmetry group of the icosahedron. $A_5$ is the symmetry group of choice for most viruses <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-symmetries-of-covid-19">but not the Corona-virus</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3264</strong></p>
<p>3264 is the correct solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner%27s_conic_problem">Steiner&#8217;s conic problem</a> asking for the number of conics in $\mathbb{P}^2_{\mathbb{C}}$ tangent to five given conics in general position.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.juliahomotopycontinuation.org/images/given_conics_example.png" width=60% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>Steiner himself claimed that there were $7776=6^5$ such conics, but realised later that he was wrong. The correct number was first given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_de_Jonqui%C3%A8res">Ernest de Jonquières</a> in 1859, but a rigorous proof had to await the advent of modern intersection theory.</p>
<p>Eisenbud and Harris wrote a book on intersection theory in algebraic geometry, freely available online: <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/joeharris/files/000-final-3264.pdf">3264 and all that</a>.</p>
<p><strong>248</strong></p>
<p>248 is the dimension of the exceptional simple Lie group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_(mathematics)">$E_8$</a>. $E_8$ is also connected to the monster group.</p>
<p>If you take two Fischer involutions in the monster (elements of conjugacy class 2A) and multiply them, the resulting element surprisingly belongs to one of just 9 conjugacy classes:</p>
<p>1A,2A,2B,3A,3C,4A,4B,5A or 6A</p>
<p>The orders of these elements are exactly the dimensions of the fundamental root for the extended $E_8$ Dynkin diagram.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/e8monster.png"></p>
<p>This is yet another moonshine observation by John McKay and I wrote a couple of posts about it and about Duncan&#8217;s solution: <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-monster-graph-and-mckays-observation">the monster graph and McKay&#8217;s observation</a>, and <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/e8-from-moonshine-groups">$E_8$ from moonshine groups</a>.</p>
<p><strong>163</strong></p>
<p>163 is a remarkable number because of the &#8216;modular miracle&#8217;<br />
\[<br />
e^{\pi \sqrt{163}} = 262537412640768743.99999999999925&#8230; \]<br />
This is somewhat related to moonshine, or at least to Klein&#8217;s j-function, which by a result of Kronecker&#8217;s detects the classnumber of imaginary quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ and produces integers if the classnumber is one (as is the case for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-163})$).</p>
<p>The details are in the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-modular-miracle-of-163">the miracle of 163</a>, or in the paper by John Stillwell, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2695682?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">Modular Miracles</a>, The American Mathematical Monthly, 108 (2001) 70-76.</p>
<p>Richard Borcherds, the math-vlogger, has an entertaining video about this story: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9k_QmZbwX8">MegaFavNumbers 262537412680768000</a></p>

<p>His description of the $j$-function (at 4:13 in the movie) is simply hilarious!</p>
<p>Borcherds connects $163$ to the monster moonshine via the $j$-function, but there&#8217;s another one.</p>
<p>The monster group has $194$ conjugacy classes and monstrous moonshine assigns a &#8216;moonshine function&#8217; to each conjugacy class (the $j$-function is assigned to the identity element). However, these $194$ functions are not linearly independent and the space spanned by them has dimension exactly $163$.</p>
