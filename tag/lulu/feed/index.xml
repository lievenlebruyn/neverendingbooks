										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It looks like I&#8217;m off the hook and can relax (after a few months of rewriting/correcting/learning LaTeX-quirks). To all of you <strong>NeverEndingBooks</strong> readers : the bookproject has ended and will appear sometime this fall. It will be around 600 pages thick and cost just under 100$. This is about 4 times the amount NeverEndingBook-ers paid over at Lulu.com. To all (?!) those who did : treasure the two volumes, they will become (extremely rare) collectors&#8217; items, one fine day. Here is the final cover-design :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/coverbook.jpg" width=500 align=center></p>
<p>Compare it to the covers produced two years ago by the NeverEndingBooks-design department (thanks again Jan and the rest of the crew).</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/covernag2.jpg" width=500 align=center></p>
<p>The final fight was over the promotional material. The copywriters did include the captivating sentence &#8220;A Novel Approach to Difficult Cases in Mathematics and Physics&#8221;&#8230; Here&#8217;s my reply</p>
<blockquote><p>
I realize Im a difficult (some say hopeless) case, but there is little point advertising this. Here a few alternatives that may require spicing-up</p>
<p>&#8220;A gentle introduction to one of mathematics&#8217; (and even physics&#8217;) hottest topics&#8221;<br />
&#8220;A novel approach to noncommutative geometry&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Get rid of singularities by going noncommutative!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The first readable text on an over-hyped topic&#8230;&#8221;<br />
etc. etc.</p>
<p>I can do better if I have to, so please tell me and I&#8217;ll open up a bottle of wine.<br />
Whatever you do, please remove the difficult cases-sentence from all material.</p>
<p>atb+apologies :: lieven.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE (august 1st)</strong> : if you want to order the book for your university-library, have a look at the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/flyer.pdf">promo flyer</a>. All my suggestions (apart from the last one) are included&#8230;</p>
<p>One final comment about all of this. The project started as a bookproject with the AMS in 1999 and was abandoned (for a variety of reasons, all of them only relevant to myself) sometime early 2002.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the one thing that will hurt for some time to come. I wanted to dedicate the book to &#8220;the women in my life : my mother, Ann, Gitte&amp;Bente&#8221;. Unfortunately, my mother will never see the book. The current dedication is :</p>
<p>This book is dedicated to the women in my life<br />
Simonne Stevens (1926-2004), Ann, Gitte&amp;Bente</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/geertbook.jpg" alt="" /> </p>
<p>The third volume in the NeverEndingBooks-series will be written by <a href="http://www.win.ua.ac.be/~gvdwey/">Geert Van de Weyer</a> and will<br />
be about (double) Poisson structures in the noncommutative world. Volume<br />
4&amp;5 are becoming clearer every day and if you think you have a<br />
project fitting in this series, you can always email to<br />
[info@neverenedingbooks.org][3].   </p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/">NeverEndingBooks-URL</a>, I will<br />
probably close this blog by the end of the month (at its first<br />
birthday). The main reason is that I found out that it takes several<br />
people to maintain a mathematical blog for some time. So, if you want to<br />
co-author a group-blog on noncommutative algebra and/or noncommutative<br />
geometry, please [email me][5] (or even better, leave a comment here so<br />
that other people may be willing to join in too) and if there is enough<br />
critical mass to go ahead with the plan I will be happy to set up a<br />
group-blog at <a href="http://www.noncommutative.org/">noncommutative.org</a>.</p>
<p>At<br />
this URL I&#8217;ll probably put a frontpage for the book-series we started<br />
and which you can buy at all times via <a href="http://www.lulu.com/neverendingbooks/">lulu.com/neverendingbooks</a>. It will contain errata- and suggestions-pages for each volume and<br />
details about forthcoming books, links etc&#8230; Btw. it would probably<br />
be a good commercial move to delete TheLibrary links sooner, now that<br />
even <strong>String Theorists</strong> are driven to this site via<br />
Lazariou‚Äö√Ñ√¥s paper <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/hep-th/0507222">On<br />
the non-commutative geometry of topological D-branes</a></p>
<p>As my<br />
main objective next year will be to write courses (from first year down<br />
to post-doc level) I will set up (again) a <a href="http://www.moodle.org/">Moodle</a> site (mainly in English,<br />
although UA-students will be free to add to it in Dutch). News about it<br />
will be posted eventually at my <a href="http://www.math.ua.ac.be/~lebruyn/">regular, but forgotten<br />
homepage</a> and perhaps here.</p>
<p>Once again, if you are interested<br />
to contribute at unregular intervals to a noncommutative group-blog,<br />
please leave a comment!</p>
<p>[3]: mailto: info@neverendingbooks.org<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/lulu1.jpg" alt="" /> </p>
<p>A quick reply to some of the comments<br />
to the lulu/neverendingbooks post.  </p>
<p>_Are they also<br />
responsible for the graphical design in your books ?_ No! In fact it<br />
was one of the more pleasant experiences of the last couple of weeks to<br />
develop our own format, LaTeX-style and covers. The usual gang had their<br />
say in all of this but it is only fair to say that <a href="http://www.verbeeld.be/">Jan</a> did most of the work. We developed<br />
the cover-concept (that is, macro shots of games in duotones and placing<br />
of titles etc) by trial and error. Jan is responsible for the<br />
photo-shoot, I did choose the shots to be used and did the initial<br />
coloring and placing of titles and left the final tweaking to Jan, who<br />
did some lay-out work before. We, at least, are happy with the<br />
result&#8230; As mentioned before, the LaTeX-style sheets were made<br />
using the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/"><br />
memoir package</a>.</p>
<p>_Who is responsible for trying to sell<br />
the book, you or them?_ I dont think we are doing great efforts to<br />
try to sell the books, yet. Up to now, you can only get to the<br />
book-sites via this blog or via my <a href="http://www.math.ua.ac.be/~lebruyn">homepage</a>. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu</a> claims that they will only make<br />
money if we do&#8230; and as this is clearly sales-talk (they make money<br />
on every book they print) it involves no (or a very small) financial<br />
risk on our part. Anyone who wants to have a copy of one of our books,<br />
orders them at Lulu, they print it and ship it to you. But beware! They<br />
have several shipping options and for most of them it costs you more to<br />
get them shipped than to buy the books&#8230; In fact, that was the main<br />
reason why we didnt put the URL online before we had two volumes out.<br />
The reason being that if you buy for over 25dollars you can have them<br />
shipped via their &#8220;SuperSaver&#8221; option, that is, shipping is free (but<br />
probably slow). But, based on my own experience it works well (I ordered<br />
a few copies of book 1 via SuperSaver and another one via their<br />
InternationalShipment and got the free SuperSaver package a day before<br />
the costly other shipment&#8230;). Our real investment is that we have<br />
bought ISBN-numbers for the books (at a price of 35dollars/book) and<br />
hope to earn this back from a small royalty we get from each book (the<br />
Lulu-rule is that they get 25% of any royalties you set). Even though we<br />
are not entirely happy with the distribution process we opted for this<br />
series for an unusual book-format making it handy and fun to use (the<br />
square 7.5 x 7.5 inch format is very pleasing to read and the<br />
coil-binding makes it extremely handy to lay flat on the table). So we<br />
view this series as a student-edition of the books and we keep them as<br />
cheap as possible. At a later stage it may happen that we will also have<br />
a library-edition of the books which will have global distribution<br />
(meaning that you can order them via Amazon or your local bookshop). For<br />
this to work, you have not so much freedom in your book-format and can<br />
only have regular binding. Besides, buying such a global-ISBN is more<br />
costly and will make this edition (a lot) more expensive. But, as you<br />
can see from the picture, the books get printed and shipped and look<br />
VERY nice. In fact, of the few copies I ordered, I had to hand out<br />
already two because some people just liked the feel and touch of it. I<br />
think, people will only gradually be willing to buy their own copy when<br />
(1) they have glanced through a copy at some meeting or seminar and (2)<br />
if more volumes come out and they have a greater choice in bying 2<br />
volumes to get free shipping. On this last issue : already three people<br />
have expressed interest in writing a book in our series. My own hunch is<br />
that the next book out will have to do with Poisson noncommutative<br />
geometry and will have a macro shot of a war-game on its cover (authors<br />
can give suggestions for which games they want on their cover), curious<br />
how this will work out&#8230;</p>
<p>_How many have you sold so<br />
far?_ Well, not enough so far to get our ISBN-investment back&#8230;<br />
But, once again, I think it will take some time for people to trust the<br />
series enough to buy a volume or two. In the first week we made the URL<br />
available we sold 16 books, so if you want to increase our sales-index<br />
please do by going to <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/137684">this<br />
page</a> for the first volume and to <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/144003">this page</a> for the second<br />
volume. But perhaps it is easier to bookmark the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/neverendingbooks">lulu/neverendingbooks</a> if<br />
you want the latest news on the series. I&#8221;ll keep you posted on our<br />
sales via this page. If you buy a book and like the result, please tell<br />
others about it (or even better, let them see and feel the copy.<br />
Hopefully you will get it back&#8230;)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/book2.jpg" /><br />
</center></p>
<p>Half a year ago, it all started with NeverEndingBooks in which I set out a rather modest goal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why NeverEndingBooks? We all complain about exaggerated prices of mathematical books from<br />
certain publishers, poor quality of editing and refereeing offered, as well as far too stringent book-contracts. Rather than lamenting about this, NeverEndingBooks gives itself one year to learn (and report) about the many aspects of the book-production cycle and to explore whether an alternative exists. If at the end of this year we will have produced at least one book this experiment will be considered a success. If,<br />
however, we find out that it is an impossible task, we will explain where it all went wrong and why it is better to stick to an established PublishingHouse and accept its terms.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I assume we did manage to do it after all as you may check by visiting our <a href="http://www.lulu.com/neverendingbooks">storefront :<br />
www.lulu.com/neverendingbooks</a>. However, it all turned out to be quite different from what I had in mind half a year ago. So, perhaps it&#8217;s time to recap.</p>
<p>Originally, I&#8217;d planned to partner-up with the publisher-on-demand <a href="https://www.lightningsource.com/index.htm">LightningSource</a> but in the process they did require a VAT-number. In Belgium, the safest way to get one is to set up a non-profit organization (a VZW as we call<br />
it). But then you have to write down your legal statutes, get them published in the <a href="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/welcome.pl">Moniteur Belge</a> (at a hefty price) but what really put me off was that you have to set up a &#8220;board of directors&#8221; consisting of at least three<br />
people. I don&#8217;t mind following a folly but if I have to involve others I usually pass, so I abandoned the whole idea.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn&#8217;t help talking about the VAT-problem and at a certain time there was an idea to revive a sleeping VZW (=non-profit organization) of the <a href="http://bms.ulb.ac.be/cgi/welcome.php">Belgian Mathematical Society</a>, the MaRC (MAthematical Research Centre), the statutes of which allowed to become a publishing house. But, this wouldn&#8217;t involve just two other people but the whole BMS so I decided<br />
to forget all about it and have a short vacation in France together with a few (former)PhD-students.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/rothkoatn.jpg" /><br />
</center></p>
<p>Given plenty of sun, cheese and whine (not necessarily in that order) sooner or later we had to talk about _the_ problem. For <a href="http://www.win.ua.ac.be/~rbockl/research/">Raf</a> it was the first time he heard about it but when we realized I thought one could easily publish books well under 25 dollars he was immediately interested and insisted we should set up a board of directors and continue with the plan.</p>
<p>The different roles to play in the board were more or less self-evident : I had to be the treasurer (given the fact that I was the only with a secure, though small, income), <a href="http://www.win.ua.ac.be/~gvdwey/">Geert</a> had to become chairman (being the only one possessing suits), Raf would be secretary (being the only one who could write better Flemish than English) and <a href="http://www.math.ua.ac.be/~adri/">Jan</a> or <a href="http://www.win.ua.ac.be/~ssymens/">Stijn</a> would do PR (as they are the only ones having enough social skills).</p>
<p>So, we went back willing to go through the whole process (at least 3 months) of obtaining a VAT-number.</p>
<p>But then Raf got so interested in the whole idea that he explored other possibilities (I think he was more motivated by the fact that his sister wanted to publish her thesis rather than anything else) and came up with <a href="http://www.lulu.com/">lulu.com</a>.</p>
<p>No legal hassle, no VAT-numbers, nothing required (or so it seemed). Still, before risking his sister&#8217;s thesis he wanted to check the service out and as it is a lot easier to take a book lying around rather than write one yourself he took my <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/toolkit/pdffile.php?pdf=%2FTheLibrary%2Fbooks%2FLeBruyn2.pdf">version 2</a> and published it at Lulu&#8217;s (since then this version is nicknamed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko">Rothko@n</a>).</p>
<p>Although I gave him the permission to do so, it didn&#8217;t feel right that people should pay even a small amount for a nicely bound unedited version 2. So, the last month and a half I&#8217;ve been editing and partially rewriting version 2 and the two volumes are now <a href="http://www.lulu.com/neverendingbooks">available!</a></p>
<p>Major changes are to the 4 middle chapters. There is now chapter 3 &#8220;Etale Technology&#8221; which contains all of the etale tricks scattered earlier in two chapters, chapter 4 ‚&#8221;Quiver Representations&#8221; collects all the<br />
quiver material (again, scattered throughout the previous version). Chapter 5 ‚&#8221;Semisimple Representations&#8221; now includes recent material such as Raf&#8217;s characterization of the smooth locus of Cayley-smooth orders and our (together with Geert) classification of the central singularities, and chapter 6 ‚&#8221;Nilpotent Representations&#8221; now includes the material on Brauer-Severi varities which was in version 1 but somehow didn&#8217;t make it to version 2 before.</p>
