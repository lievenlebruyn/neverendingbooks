										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somehow I missed all the excitement, five years ago. From Bourbaki&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki#:~:text=Nicolas%20Bourbaki%20">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2018, the American musical duo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> released a concept album named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>. The album&#8217;s conceptual framework was the mythical city of &#8220;Dema&#8221; ruled by nine &#8220;bishops&#8221;; one of the bishops was named &#8220;Nico&#8221;, short for Nicolas Bourbaki. Another of the bishops was named Andre, which may refer to André Weil. Following the album&#8217;s release, there was a spike in internet searches for &#8220;Nicolas Bourbaki&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="500"><p>      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/9uj0a2/google_trends_for_nicolas_bourbaki/">Google Trends for Nicolas Bourbaki</a><br /> by      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HiLlBiLlYjOeL_">u/HiLlBiLlYjOeL_</a> in      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">twentyonepilots</a>    </p></blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script></p>
<p>With summer and retirement coming up, I&#8217;m all in for <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/?s=bourbaki">another Bourbaki riddle</a>.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Joseph">Tyler Joseph</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dun">Josh Dun</a> have weaved complicated storylines around the different albums of their band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> (or TØP for short), each referring to a distinct era (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurryface">Blurryface</a>-era, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>-era, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_and_Icy">Scaled and Icy</a>-ra, etc.), each having a different color scheme, characters and so on.</p>
<p>You can easily get lost forever in their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">sub-Reddit</a>, or the numerous YouTube-clips and blogposts made by the &#8216;clique&#8217; (as their fanbase calls itself). Perhaps the quickest intro in the TØP-world is <a href="https://topmasterdoc.carrd.co/#homepage">this site</a>.</p>
<p>The Bourbaki-group is important to the Trench-era, yet there are very few direct references in the songs. There&#8217;s the song <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-morph-lyrics">&#8220;Morph&#8221;</a> (lol!) containing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
He&#8217;ll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki<br />
He&#8217;s got no friends close, but those who know him most know<br />
He goes by Nico<br />
He told me I&#8217;m a copy<br />
When I&#8217;d hear him mock me, that&#8217;s almost stopped me
</p></blockquote>
<p>So Nico=Nicolas Bourbaki, and there&#8217;s the song <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-nico-and-the-niners-lyrics">&#8220;Nico and the niners&#8221;</a></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMAPyGoqQVw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>starting off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>
East is up<br />
I&#8217;m fearless when I hear this on the low<br />
East is up<br />
I&#8217;m careless when I wear my rebel clothes<br />
East is up<br />
When Bishops come together they will know that<br />
Dema don&#8217;t control us, Dema don&#8217;t control<br />
East is up
</p></blockquote>
<p>and that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover Dema and the Bishops in later posts, but for now remember the mantra &#8220;East is up&#8221;, which supposedly indicates the direction of escape from the Bishops and the city of Dema.</p>
<p>A few months before the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, a <a href="https://www.dmaorg.site/original/found/15398642_14/clancy.html">mysterious website</a> appeared, containing letters from someone called &#8216;Clancy&#8217; and some pictures and gifs. One of these pictures was soon found out to be part of an iconic photo of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Se_elf.jpg" width=60%><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Weil.jpg" width=60%><br />
</center></p>
<p>This caught the attention of the &#8216;clique&#8217; because another picture indicated that the name of one of the Bishops was Andre.</p>
<p>Poor Andre was credited for just two things he managed to do : he founded a secret group of mathematicians, called Nicolas Bourbaki (important because another Bishop&#8217;s name was &#8216;Nico&#8217;) and he invented the symbol $\emptyset$ for the empty set (important because TØP used it since the Blurryface-era). I guess most mathematicians will remember Andre Weil for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil_conjectures">other things</a>.</p>
<p>The clique-consensus seems to be that the girl next to Andre (some even thought it was a boy) is his daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvie_Weil">Sylvie Weil</a>.</p>
<p>If you ever read her novel <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Chez-Weil-Andr%C3%A9-Simone-Sylvie/dp/2283023696">Chez les Weil</a> you&#8217;ll remember that Sylvie did have from a very young age the same exuberant hairstyle as her aunt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a>. So no, she&#8217;s definitely not Sylvie.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll save my theory as to where and when this photo was taken, who the girl next to Andre is, and how this picture was used later on in TØP-iconography, for another post.</p>
<p>For now, I just want to point out one tiny detail: the girl is shielding her eyes from the blistering summer-sun, and shadows are falling from right to left.</p>
<p>Got it? Yes: East is up!</p>
<p>The Bourbaki-hype intensified when Tyler Joseph tweeded on August 19th, indicating that a new Album called &#8216;Trench&#8217; was coming up:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">finally looking at mastered files.<br />album finished.<br />Trench<br />||-// <a href="https://t.co/xrN0cgbymd">pic.twitter.com/xrN0cgbymd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; tyler jøseph (@tylerrjoseph) <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerrjoseph/status/1030991703203897345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Again, there&#8217;s a lot more to say about this tweet, but for now look at the desktop-image. It&#8217;s part of one of the most known Bourbaki images of all time (also featuring on their Wikipedia page): the Dieulefit 1938-congress (which we discovered to be taken at <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-and-the-miracle-of-silence">Beauvallon</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BeauvallonTop.png" width=100%></p>
<p>(Left to right: Simone Weil, C. Pisot, Andre Weil, Jean Dieudonne (seated), Claude Chabauty, Charles Ehresmann and Jean Delsarte)</p>
<p>Ah, you spotted it too? We&#8217;ll come back to this, and the clique made even more surprising discoveries wrt this picture.</p>
<p>You see, we&#8217;ll have a lot of ground to cover, so let&#8217;s stick to the &#8220;East is up&#8221; motto,for now.</p>
<p>Via Google maps you can check that the exit-door in the picture is located to the East side of the main building of the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_de_Beauvallon">Ecole de Beauvallon</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/beauvalloneast.png" width=100%></p>
<p>All Bourbakie-congress followers are outside, so does this mean they&#8217;ve escaped Dema? Are they now Banditos (whence the Yellow-background-color)?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard about Banditos or te relevance of the color Yellow, we&#8217;ll cover that too.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another &#8216;East is up&#8217;-side to the Beauvallon-story. For this we have to recall some of the history of the spiritual father of the B-gang, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Denis_Bourbaki">General Charles-Denis Bourbaki</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />

<p>In the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, he was given the command of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm%C3%A9e_de_l%27Est">&#8216;armee de l&#8217;Est</a> (yes, the &#8216;East&#8217;-army!), a ramshackle of ill-trained men.</p>
<p>After some initial successes they suffered defeat in the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataille_d%27H%C3%A9ricourt_(1871)">battle of Lizaine</a> and were forced to escape to Switzerland (Yes: East!) where they were disarmed, and treated for their injuries (this was one of the first cases of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement">International Red Cross</a>, and is remembered in the <a href="https://www.bourbakipanorama.ch/">Bourbaki Panorama in Luzern</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://holzerkobler.com/sites/default/files/styles/hka__fullscreen/public/554_foto_radekbrunecky_mg_5278es-srgb.jpg?itok=fk1L8zMn" width=100% ></p>
<p>For clique-people: Red cross &#038; Red architecture of the Boubaki-panorama = color of the Bishops.</p>
<p>Anyway, the important fact is that General Bourbaki had to escape to the East.</p>
<p>During the Bourbaki-congress in Beauvallon in 1938 a similar situation occurred. From Andre Weil&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Mathematician-Andre-Weil/dp/3764326506">The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician</a> (page 123-124):</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 1938, Bourbaki held a congress in Dieulefit, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chabauty">Chabauty</a>, who had joined the ranks of the Master&#8217;s collaborators, had familie ties. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan">Elie Cartan</a> graciously joined us and took part in some of our discussions.</p>
<p>This was precisely the time of the Munich conference. There were sinister forebodings in the air. We devoured the newspapers and huddled over the radio: this was one Bourbaki congress where hardly any real work was accomplished.</p>
<p>By the time I had resolved that, if war broke out, I would refuse to serve. In the middle of the congress, after confiding in Delsarte, I thought up some pretext or other and left for Switzerland.</p>
<p>But the immediate threat of war soon seemed to have dissipated, so I returned after two days.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there&#8217;s a remarkable analogy between General Bourbaki&#8217;s escape to the East in 1871, and Andre and Simone Weil&#8217;s flight to the East at the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement">Munich agreement</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the &#8216;East is up&#8217; mantra is not the only reason why Tyler Joseph used these two Bourbaki-related photos in his narrative, but it illustrates that none of these choices is arbitrary.</p>
<p>I think Tyler knows a lot about Bourbaki. His knowledge about them goes certainly deeper than that of the average clique-member (who state that Bourbaki was a group of mathematicians trying to prove God&#8217;s existence, or that there where exactly nine Bourbaki founders, corresponding to the nine Bishops of Dema).</p>
<p>But then, TØP never corrects erroneous clique-statements, every fan-theory is correct to them. In fact, they see the interactions with their fanbase as a collective work in storytelling: they pose a riddle, the clique proposes various possible solutions, and afterwards they may use one of these proposals in their further work.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interview making clear that Tyler knows a lot more about Bourbaki than most people (1.50 till 4.40)</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IsJkXMMAssI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>
Interviewer: &#8220;How far are you into a Wikipedia wormhole when you come across this? (the Bourbaki group)&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;No, no THEY named their group after Nicolas Bourbaki&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;but there is no Nicolas Bourbaki, right?&#8221;<br />
Tyler: They named their group after Blurryface.&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;Even though it was the 1930&#8243;s?&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;So how does it relate?&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;its EVERYTHING and at the same time, has nothing to do with it&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;See I&#8217;m no good at math, this is difficult for me.&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;Math?! *laughs* Math has nothing to do with it&#8230; and yet it has everything to do with it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, in the next couple of posts I&#8217;ll use the little I know about the Bourbaki group trying to make sense of the Trench-era narrative.</p>
