										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://geekymom.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-am-i-blogging.html"><br />
Geeky Mom : Why am I blogging?</a>. Been there before. Sooner or later<br />
all non-pseudonomenous bloggers are faced with the same dilemmas.<br />
There&#8217;s really no answer or advice to give except : blog when you feel<br />
like it, if not do something different, after all its just one of those<br />
billion of blogs around.</p>
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/">Texmaker</a> : another<br />
LaTeX-frontend, possibly having a few extras such as : a structure-pane<br />
including labels you gave to formulas, theorems etc. (click on them<br />
brings you to them). Intend to use it now as I&#8217;m in another rewrite of<br />
<strong>the</strong> never-ending-book..</p>
<p><a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a> : &#8220;Designed for<br />
humans first and machines second, microformats are a set of simple, open<br />
data formats built upon existing and widely adopted standards.&#8221; May<br />
have another look.</p>
<p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> : a recurring<br />
link. At times when I feel learning key-strokes may save me a lot of<br />
time I have (another) go at Quicksilver. Last week, Ive reinstalled this<br />
blog more or less post by post and used keystrokes to send a line in the<br />
SQL-file of the database dump of NEB as a clipping to Scrivener to<br />
MultiMarkdown it further. I used the app <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/20192">Service Scrubber</a><br />
to define my own key-strokes. Must have another go at Quicksilver soon.<br />
Im sure it distinguishes ‚&#8221;power mac users&#8221; from the rest of<br />
us.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.jeffsandquist.com/default.aspx/GTD/GTDTools.html"><br />
List of GTDTools</a> : a good list of GTD-software. I&#8217;m probably just<br />
too chaotic for GTD to improve my workflow but somehow I cannot resist<br />
trying some of these things out.</p>
<p><a href="http://lifedev.net/">LifeDEV</a> : One of those sites that tells<br />
me I should take GTD more seriously</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jimmcgowan.net/Site/DoIt.html">DoIt</a> : One of<br />
these GTD-tools. It is said to go well with Quicksilver, so maybe, one<br />
day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freeverse.com/think/">Think</a><br />
: Here a little seemingly completely useless tool which works well (at<br />
least for me). No, it does not make you think, but at least it helps you<br />
while you are thinking (or doing anything a bit focussed). Install it<br />
and enjoy! The principle is that it just blocks out all other open<br />
windows (and there are keystrokes (yes, again) to get you quickly in<br />
and out.) Besides, it looks great. It&#8217;s in my dock and this says it<br />
all</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkature.com/">Thinkature</a> :<br />
a brainstorming tool. Dont know why I did bookmark this. Perhaps one<br />
day, a few years from now</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.archive.org/details/lecture11461">Stafford Talk</a> :<br />
a talk by Toby Stafford I came across by accident. Maybe there are other<br />
interesting talks on the site?</p>
<p><a
href="http://scq.ubc.ca/sciencescouts/">Science Scouts</a> : a great<br />
idea! Give yourself badges for how well you do science (or talk/write<br />
about science). Have to collect my badges soon. I&#8217;m sure this only<br />
works for people with a scouting-history, but who<br />
knows?</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.macresearch.org/">MacResearch</a> : Here&#8217;s a site<br />
that may become useful. MacResearch.org is an open and independent<br />
community for scientists using Mac OS X and related hardware in their<br />
research. It is the mission of this site to cultivate a knowledgeable<br />
and vibrant community of researchers to exchange ideas and information,<br />
and collectively escalate the prominence of Apple technologies in the<br />
scientific research community. They have some interesting articles<br />
and tutorials on e.g. DevonThink and BibDesk etc. Worth to<br />
revisit.</p>

">Jennifer in love</a> : well‚ should I say something about this?<br />
probably best not.</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/ui_breakthroughcomma.html"><br />
Breakthrough CLI</a> : another pamphlet in favor of the Command Line! A<br />
must read for those who perfer GUIs to CLIs.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>

site</a> : Rod is working hard on CLI-20. Whenever he releases version<br />
2.0, neverendingbooks will be among the first sites to run it. I still<br />
love the idea.</p>

href="http://www.hep.phys.soton.ac.uk/~evans/NL/bits.html">the Newton<br />

Perhaps this is the best investment of time/energy : write a popular<br />
science book rather than another paper. Read half way through it (sorry<br />
but not the best prose Ive read so far), may continue but was held up<br />
reading a (real) murder mystery Equinox featuring also Newton and<br />
alchemy (must be in the air somehow), also not the best mystery read<br />
so far</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can<br />
software help mathematicians to keep up with the neverending (sic) flood<br />
of new research material? In the past I touched this already&#8230;    Recently, there is a new fairly active Google group<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/The-Efficient-Academic">the<br />
efficient academic</a> which describes its interests as</p>
<blockquote><p> Professors, Instructors, and Graduate Students<br />
interested in getting things done more easily and quickly. We discuss<br />
organization, task management, and tools that helps us to be more<br />
productive and not procrastinate. We tend to discuss David Allen&#8217;s<br />
GTD system but not exclusively. (278 members)  </p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think GTD is far too management-driven to be useful in<br />
research, but I&#8217;m equally convinced that there are nice programs<br />
around that I have to delve deeper into, in particular <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php">DevonThinkPro</a>.<br />
Fortunately, <a href="http://www.mit.edu/people/cabi/blog/">Serkan Cabi</a> has<br />
written two interesting posts on applications of DevonThink to<br />
physics-research :   </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.mit.edu/people/cabi/blog/2005/09/devonthink-for-scientists-part-i.html">DEVONthink for Scientists: Part I</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mit.edu/people/cabi/blog/2005/09/devonthink-for-scientists-part-ii.html">DEVONthink for Scientists: Part II</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>   which can help me a bit. In the second post<br />
appears another useful resource for the average desperate present-day<br />
ringtheorist. <a href="http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~karczmar/">Joanna Karczmarek</a><br />
can help you to put the <a href="http://torrent.rutgers.edu/">Hep-th<br />
on Your Harddrive</a>. A mere 8Gb containing all material published on<br />
hep-th over the years, just waiting to be put in a database-tool like<br />
DevonThink or, if you still need an excuse to buy one, on your iPod to<br />
read on your daily commute&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/mindontracks.jpg" /></p>
<p>I just<br />
started putting my mind on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">tracks</a> but it will take<br />
me a couple of days to offload most of the crap that keeps me awake at<br />
night. There are three main components to Tracks: Next actions, Contexts<br />
and Projects.  </p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Contexts</strong> are very flexible, and can<br />
be places, states of mind or modes of working in which actions can be<br />
taken. Next actions can be assigned to and sorted by context so that you<br />
know when you are able to make progress with items. e.g. &#8220;Library&#8221;,<br />
&#8220;Shops&#8221; or &#8220;Tired&#8221;.&#8221; So far I added only 10 contexts : _@inbox_,<br />
_@books_, _@email_, _@home_, _@neverending_,<br />
_@courses_, _@other_, _@papers_, _@computer_<br />
and _@personal_. Probably I&#8217;ll have to add others such as<br />
_@refereeing_ etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Projects</strong>  : any goal<br />
which requires more than one next action to take it to completion is a<br />
Project. In Tracks, you can view your next actions by Project.&#8221; So far I<br />
added the first few things that came to mind ranging from small-easy<br />
things such as <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">_Learn<br />
VoodooPad_</a> over _Paper with Jan_ to neverending-things<br />
like Write nag@n !</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Next<br />
actions</strong> : These are the heart of GTD. They are the very next<br />
physical action that can be taken on something. It&#8217;s best to phrase<br />
these in an active way e.g. &#8220;Call Bob about the committee meeting&#8221; or<br />
&#8220;Search for a reputable garage&#8221;.&#8221; Up to now I merely added the next<br />
foreseeable action in each project together with a few urgent persoanl<br />
matters. It is a good idea to give each of these a deadline so they<br />
appear on the screen with a color-code giving the date and red (urgent),<br />
orange (coming up) to green (some day). I realize I&#8217;ve been rather<br />
relaxed about my projects so far!</p>
<p>More information on tracks can<br />
be found <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/wiki">here</a>. Try it<br />
out!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Perhaps I can surprise you by admitting that I&#8217;ve spend a lot of time lately getting through Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-free Productivity,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps I<br />
can surprise you by admitting that I&#8217;ve spend a lot of time lately<br />
getting through <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749922648/qid=1114626476/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/026-4789491-9030823">Getting Things Done:<br />
The Art of Stress-free Productivity</a>, 250+ pages of management<br />
babble. Probably you will even be shocked when I tell you that this book<br />
is published in the same series as _Body Talk at Work_,<br />
_Corporate Charisma_, _More Time Less Stress_, _Mrs<br />
Moneypenny : Survival in the City_ and more of these. All in all, it<br />
wasn&#8217;t so bad. It is a bit pompous at times, could be 50% condensed but<br />
I wanted to find out first hand what all the <strong>GTD</strong> hype<br />
was about (see <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php?p=143">this post</a> for<br />
some of the more interesting links).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not looking for a miracle<br />
method to become more productive or focussed (although I wouldn&#8217;t mind<br />
either at the moment). No, my main motivation is simply : I want to be<br />
able to sleep better!</p>
<p>This requires some explaining. The last<br />
couple of months, I regularly wake up in the middle of the night and as<br />
there are plenty of things on my mind, I start brooding on them and,<br />
more often than not, loose a couple of hours sleep/night. And these<br />
quickly add up! Now, the basis of the GTD-mantra is getting all the<br />
_stuff_ out of your head to reach the _mind like water_<br />
state whatever that means. And I can see some sense in putting all your<br />
current projects and worries somewhere on paper or computer, setting up<br />
a system that forces you to read through these lists at regular<br />
intervals, plan _next actions_ and update the lists accordingly.<br />
If you trust this system it just may free your mind from all the<br />
stuff!</p>
<p>At a later stage I may end up setting up such a system<br />
following the suggestions of the <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=904"><br />
DevonThink Forum</a> or using <a href="http://www.tyborg.com/2003/07/28/software-gadget-voodoopad"><br />
VoodooPad</a> but at the moment all I want is to offload my mind as<br />
quickly as possible to a GTD-able database. </p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog/">But She&#8217;s a Girl</a> has<br />
compiled such a system : <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks, a GTD Web<br />
Application</a>. At first I did the mistake following the generic<br />
install instructions and quickly got lost in downloading packages from<br />
SourceForge etc. until I found that there was an easy <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/wiki/Tracks/Install/Mac">Mac OS X<br />
Install Page</a>. There is a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/discord/Ruby/">Ruby and Rails .dmg<br />
package</a> but first you have to install <a href="http://tcltkaqua.sourceforge.net/">Tcl/Tk Aqua</a>. After these<br />
easy steps, you have to follow the <a href="http://dev.rousette.org.uk/file/trunk/tracks/doc/README.txt?rev=72
">install man page</a> which involves setting up a MySQL database and<br />
filling it with the required tables (I have been using<br />
<strong>phpmyadmin</strong> for this, but discovered in the process <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/">CocoaMySQL</a> which makes all<br />
this even simpler). Finally, you have to get to prompt-level and type<br />
the magic commands</p>
<p>_cd Sites/tracks_</p>
<p>_ruby<br />
script/server &#8220;&#8221;environment=production&#8221; port=3030_</p>
<p>(note<br />

step whenever you want to add material). Then,<br />
_http://127.0.0.1:3030/login/signup_ gets you to a nice<br />
webpage-interface and you can start to offload your mind of<br />
_stuff_. I&#8217;ll report later whether it did have any effect at<br />
all!.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/how_does_a_nerd.html">nerd<br />
implimentation of GTD</a> is based on plain text-files, or more<br />
precisely  </p>
<p>&#8211; all lists in text files, kept in directory<br />
&#8220;~/Documents/txt&#8221;<br /> &#8211; all documents maintained in Markdown for easy<br />
HTML conversion  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing HTML-code since the times<br />
that the best browser around was something called <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Divisions/PublicAffairs/MosaicHistory/history.html">NCSA Mosaic</a> so I&#8217;ve never paid too much attention to<br />
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a><br />
before. Here is its main purpose</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is a<br />
text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to<br />
write using 	an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then<br />
convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or >HTML). 	Thus, Markdown is<br />
two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool,<br />
	written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to<br />
HTML.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of Markdown-code followed by its<br />
HTML-output can be seen at the <a href="http://bluecloth.rubyforge.org/">BlueCloth website</a> and I have<br />
to agree that the Markdown text is very legible. I&#8217;ve been playing<br />
around with Markdown for a couple of days now (in fact this post is<br />
written in Markdown as WordPress has a Markdown-plugin) and have found a<br />
few uses for it (more on this another time). Essential sites to visit if<br />
you want to learn some Markdown are : its <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">basic<br />
syntax</a> and in the rare cases that this doesn&#8217;t do what you want to<br />
do there is also a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">full<br />
syntax</a> page.</p>
<p>If you want to use Markdown to write your<br />
HTML-pages you need to be able to convert Markdown to HTML (and<br />
conversely although the uses for this are not immediately clear, but<br />
there are plenty of good reasons!). That&#8217;s what the<br />
<strong>Markdown.pl</strong> Perl-script does for you (one way) and the<br />
Python-script <strong>html2text.py</strong> (to be found <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/">here</a>) (the other<br />
way).</p>
<p>To get them working using <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml">BBedit</a><br />
all you have to do is to put them in the _BBEdit Support/Unix<br />
Support/Unix Filters_ directory (to be found in the BBEdit-folder in<br />
_/Applications_). Then, if you have written a Markdown-text, do a<br />
_Select All_ go to the <strong>!#</strong> menu and look for<br />
Markdown.pl under _Unix Filters_ and voila, you have valid XHTML<br />
(the other direction is similar).</p>
<p>This is a bit of work and one<br />
would like to do both operations in nearly all Applications using the<br />
_Services Menu_ (in fact, until a few weeks ago I had no clue<br />
that there was something as useful as this menu hidden under the<br />
program-name-menu of any Cocoa-program!). This is best done using <a href="http://gu.st/proj/HumaneText.service/">HumaneText.service</a>. The<br />
installation is really as siimple as they say on this page (although it<br />
took me a couple of trials before it worked, and I use the Services-menu<br />
rather than the keystroke-shortcuts). </p>
<p><strong>HumaneText</strong> works perfectly with TextEdit,<br />
SubEthaEdit and (probably more important to mathematicians) TeXShop and<br />
iTeXMac (the two most common front-ends for (La)TeX under OS X). A<br />
noteworthy exception is BBEdit (hence the above laborious work-around).<br />
Sometimes there are problems with punctuation in the conversion but you<br />
can get around this using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m always<br />
extremely slow to pick up a trend (let alone a hype), in mathematics as<br />
well as in real life. It took me over a year to know of the existence of<br />
_blogs_ and to realize that they were a much easier way to<br />
maintain a webpage than manually modifying HTML-pages. But, eventually I<br />
sometimes get there, usually with the help of the <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/">mac-dev-center</a>. So, once again,<br />
I read their <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2005/03/08/productivity.html
">gettings things done with your mac</a> article long after it was<br />
posted and completely unaware of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/104-3738293-1714365">Getting Things Done</a> (or GTD) hype.  </p>
<p>At first, it just<br />
sounds as one of those boring managament-nonsense-peptalk things (and<br />
probably that is precisely what it generically is). Or what do you think<br />
about the following resume from <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/getting_started.html">Getting<br />
started with &#8216;Getting things done&#8217;</a> :</p>
<ol>
<li>identify all the<br />
stuff in your life that isn√ït in the right place (close all open<br />
loops)</li>
<li>get rid of the stuff that isn√ït yours or you don√ït<br />
need right now</li>
<li>create a right place that you trust and that<br />
supports your working style and values</li>
<li>put your stuff in the<br />
right place, consistently</li>
<li>do your stuff in a way that honors<br />
your time, your energy, and the context of any given moment</li>
<li>iterate and refactor mercilessly</li>
</ol>
<p>But in fact there is<br />
also some interesting material around at the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 folders</a> website which bring this<br />
management-talk closer to home such as the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/how_does_a_nerd.html">How does a<br />
nerd hack GTD?</a> post.</p>
<p>Also of interest are his findings after<br />
a year working with the GTD setup. These are contained in three posts :<br />
<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/12/a_year_of_getti.html">A Year<br />
of Getting Things Done: Part 1, The Good Stuff</a>, followed by <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/12/a_year_of_getti_1.html">A Year of<br />
Getting Things Done: Part 2, The Stuff I Wish I Were Better At</a> to<br />
end with <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/12/a_year_of_getti_2.html">A Year of<br />
Getting Things Done: Part 3, The Future of GTD?</a>. If these three<br />
postings don&#8217;t get you intrigued, nothing else will.</p>
<p>So, is<br />
there something like _GMD : Getting Mathematics Done_? Clearly, I<br />
don&#8217;t mean getting theorems proved, that&#8217;s a thing of a few seconds of<br />
inspiration and months to fill in the gaps. But, perhaps all this GTD<br />
and the software mentioned can be of some help to manage the<br />
everyday-workflow of mathematicians, such as checking the arXiv and the<br />
web, maintaining an email-, pdf- and BiBTeX-database, drafting papers,<br />
books and courses etc. </p>
<p>In the next few weeks I&#8217;ll try out some<br />
of the tricks. Probably another way to state this is the question &#8220;which<br />
Apps will survive Tiger?&#8221; Now that it is official that <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/overview/">Tiger</a> (that is, Mac<br />
10.4 to non-apple eaters) will be released by the end of the month it is<br />
time to rethink which of the tools I really like to keep and which is<br />
just useless garbage I picked up along the road. For example, around<br />
this time last year I had a <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl<br />
phase</a> and bought half a meter or so of O&#8217;Reilly Perl-books. And yes<br />
I did write a few simple scripts, some useful such as my own <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/arxiv.shtml">arXiv RSS-feeds</a>,<br />
some not so useful as a web-spider I wrote to check on changes in the<br />
list of hamepages of people working in non-commutative algebra and<br />
geometry. A year later I realize I&#8217;ll never become a <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perl Monk</a>. So from now on I want to<br />
make my computer-life as useful and easy as possible, relying on wizards<br />
to provide me with cool software to use and help me enjoy mathematics<br />
even more. I&#8217;ll keep you posted how my GMD-adventure goes.</p>
