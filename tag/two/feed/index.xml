										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/some-skew-smullyan-stumpers">Last time</a> we had a brief encounter with the island of two truths, invented by <a href="https://we.vub.ac.be/en/karin-cvetko-vah">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a>. See her posts:</p>

</ul>
<p>On this island, false statements have truth-value $0$ (as usual), but non-false statements are not necessarily true,  but can be given either truth-value $Q$ (statements which the Queen on the island prefers) or $K$ (preferred by the King).</p>
<p>Think of the island as Trump&#8217;s paradise where nobody is ever able to say: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts">&#8220;Look, alternative truths are not truths. They&#8217;re falsehoods.&#8221;</a></p>

</center></p>
<p>Even the presence of just one &#8216;alternative truth&#8217; has dramatic consequences on the rationality of your reasoning. If we know the truth-values of specific sentences, we can determine the truth-value of more complex sentences in which we use logical connectives such as $\vee$ (or), $\wedge$ (and), $\neg$ (not), and $\implies$ (then) via these truth tables:</p>
<p>\[<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\downarrow~\bf{\wedge}~\rightarrow &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
Q &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; Q \\<br />
K &#038; 0 &#038; K &#038; K<br />
\end{array} \quad<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\downarrow~\vee~\rightarrow &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
Q &#038; Q &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
K &#038; K &#038; Q &#038; K<br />
\end{array} \]<br />
\[<br />
\begin{array}{c|ccc}<br />
\downarrow~\implies~\rightarrow &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; Q &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
Q &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K \\<br />
K &#038; 0 &#038; Q &#038; K<br />
\end{array} \quad<br />
\begin{array}{c|c}<br />
 \downarrow &#038; \neg~\downarrow \\<br />
\hline<br />
0 &#038; Q \\<br />
Q &#038; 0 \\<br />
K &#038; 0<br />
\end{array}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Note that the truth-values $Q$ and $K$ are not completely on equal footing as we have to make a choice which one of them will stand for $\neg 0$.</p>
<p>Common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)">tautologies</a> are no longer valid on this island. The best we can have are $Q$-tautologies (giving value $Q$ whatever the values of the components) or $K$-tautologies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one $Q$-tautology (check!) : $(\neg p) \vee (\neg \neg p)$. Verify that $p \vee (\neg p)$ is neither a $Q$- nor a $K$-tautology.</p>
<p>Can you find any $K$-tautology at all?</p>
<p>Already this makes it incredibly difficult to adapt Smullyan-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves">Knights and Knaves</a> puzzles to this skewed island. <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/some-skew-smullyan-stumpers">Last time</a> I gave one easy example.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/2island2.png" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle</strong> : On an island of two truths all inhabitants are either Knaves (saying only false statements), Q-Knights (saying only $Q$-valued statements) or K-Knights (who only say $K$-valued statements).</p>
<p>The King came across three inhabitants, whom we will call $A$, $B$ and $C$. He asked $A$: &#8220;Are you one of my  Knights?&#8221; $A$ answered, but so indistinctly that the King could not understand what he said.</p>
<p>He then asked $B$: &#8220;What did he say?&#8221; $B$ replies: &#8220;He said that he is a Knave.&#8221; At this point, $C$ piped up and said: &#8220;That&#8217;s not true!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was $C$ a Knave, a Q-Knight or a K-Knight?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> : Q- and K-Knights can never claim to be a Knave. Neither can Knaves because they can only say false statements. So, no inhabitant on the island can ever claim to be a Knave. So, $B$ lies and is a Knave, so his stament has truth-value $0$. $C$ claims the negation of what $B$ says so the truth-value of his statement is $\neg 0 = Q$. $C$ must be a Q-Knight.</p>
<p>As if this were not difficult enough, Karin likes to complicate things by letting the Queen and King assign their own truth-values to all sentences, which may coincide with their actual truth-value or not.</p>
<p>Clearly, these two truth-assignments follow the logic of the island of two truths for composed sentences, and we impose one additional rule: if the Queen assigns value $0$ to a statement, then so does the King, and vice versa.</p>
<p>I guess she wanted to set the stage for variations to the island of two truths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_modal_logic">epistemic modal logical</a> puzzles as in Smullyan&#8217;s book <a href="https://raymondsmullyan.com/books/forever-undecided/">Forever Undecided</a> (for a quick summary, have a look at Smullyan&#8217;s paper <a href="http://www.tark.org/proceedings/tark_mar19_86/p341-smullyan.pdf">Logicians who reason about themselves</a>).</p>
<p>A possible interpretation of the Queen&#8217;s truth-assignment is that she assigns value $Q$ to all statements she believes to be true, value $0$ to all statements she believes to be false, and value $K$ to all statements she has no fixed opinion on (she neither believes them to be true nor false). The King assigns value $K$ to all statements he believes to be true, $0$ to those he believes to be false, and $Q$ to those he has no fixed opinion on.</p>
<p>For example, if the Queen has no fixed opinion on $p$ (so she assigns value $K$ to it), then the King can either believe $p$ (if he also assigns value $K$ to it) or can have no fixed opinion on $p$ (if he assigns value $Q$ to it), but he can never believe $p$ to be false.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/2island3.png" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p><strong>Puzzle</strong> : We say that Queen and King &#8216;agree&#8217; on a statement $p$ if they both assign the same value to it. So, they agree on all statements one of them (and hence both) believe to be false. But there&#8217;s more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show that Queen and King agree on the negation of all statements one of them believes to be false.</li>
<li>Show that the King never believes the negation of whatever statement.</li>
<li>Show that the Queen believes all negations of statements the King believes to be false.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> : If one of them believes $p$ to be false (s)he will assign value $0$ to $p$ (and so does the other), but then they both have to assign value $Q$ to $\neg p$, so they agree on this.</p>
<p>The value of $\neg p$ can never be $K$, so the King does not believe $\neg p$.</p>
<p>If the King believes $p$ to be false he assigns value $0$ to it, and so does the Queen, but then the value of $\neg p$ is $Q$ and so the Queen believes $\neg p$.</p>
<p>We see that the Queen and King agree on a lot of statements, they agree on all statements one of them believes to be false, and they agree on the negation of such statements!</p>
<p>Can you find any statement at all on which they do not agree?</p>
<p>Well, that may be a little bit premature. We didn&#8217;t say which sentences about the island are allowed, and what the connection (if any) is between the Queen and King&#8217;s value-assignments and the actual truth values.</p>
<p>For example, the Queen and King may agree on a classical ($0$ or $1$) truth-assignments to the atomic sentences for the island, and replace all $1$&#8217;s with $Q$. This will give a consistent assignment of truth-values, compatible with the island&#8217;s strange logic. (We cannot do the same trick replacing $1$&#8217;s by $K$ because $\neg 0 = Q$).</p>
<p>Clearly, such a system may have no relation at all with the intended meaning of these sentences on the island (the actual truth-values).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="https://we.vub.ac.be/en/karin-cvetko-vah">Karin Cvetko-Vah</a> introduced the notions of &#8216;loyalty&#8217; and &#8216;sanity&#8217; for inhabitants of the island. That&#8217;s for next time, and perhaps then you&#8217;ll be able to answer the question whether Queen and King agree on all statements.</p>
