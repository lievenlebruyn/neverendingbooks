										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week i was at the conference <a href="http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2012/485/info.php3?wsid=485&#038;venue=Oort">Noncommutative Algebraic Geometry and its Applications to Physics</a> at the <a href="http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/">Lorentz center</a> in Leiden.</p>

<p>It was refreshing to go to a conference where i knew only a handful of people beforehand and where everything was organized to Oberwolfach perfection. Perhaps i&#8217;ll post someday on some of the (to me) more interesting talks.</p>
<p>Also interesting were some discussions about the Elsevier-boycot-fallout and proposals to go beyong that boycot and i will certainly post about that later. At the moment there is still an embargo on some information, but anticipate a statement from the editorial board of the journal of number theory soon&#8230;</p>
<p>I was asked to talk about &#8220;algebraic D-branes&#8221;, probably because it sounded like an appropriate topic for a conference on noncommutative algebraic geometry claiming to have connections with physics. I saw it as an excuse to promote the type of noncommutative geometry i like based on representation schemes.</p>
<p>If you like to see the slides of my talk you can find the handout-version <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/LeidenHandout.pdf">here</a>. They should be pretty self-exploratory, but if you like to read an unedited version of what i intended to tell with every slide you can find that text <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/LeidenTalk.pdf">here</a>.</p>
