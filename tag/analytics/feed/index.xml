										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday january 2nd around 18hr NeB-stats went crazy.</p>
<p>Referrals clarified that the post <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/what-is-the-knot-associated-to-a-prime.html">&#8216;What is the knot associated to a prime?&#8217;</a> was picked up at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/">Reddit/math</a> and remained nr.1 for about a day.</p>
<p>Now, the dust has settled, so let&#8217;s learn from the experience.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/reddit1.jpg"></p>
<p>A Reddit-mention is to a blog what doping is to a sporter.</p>
<p>You get an immediate boost in the most competitive of all blog-stats, the number of unique vistors (blue graph), but is doesn&#8217;t result in a long-term effect, and, it may even be harmful to more essential blog-stats, such as the average time visitors spend on your site (yellow graph).</p>
<p>For NeB the unique vistors/day fluctuate normally around 300, but peaked to 1295 and 1733 on the &#8216;Reddit-days&#8217;. In contrast, the avg. time on site is normally around 3 minutes, but dropped the same days to 44 and 30 seconds!</p>
<p>Whereas some of the Reddits spend enough time to read the post and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/ev1gq/what_is_the_knot_associated_to_a_prime/">comment on it</a>, the vast majority zap from one link to the next. Having monitored the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/math/">Reddit/math</a> page for two weeks, I&#8217;m convinced that post only made it because it was visually pretty good. The average Reddit/math-er is a viewer more than a reader&#8230;</p>
<p>So, should I go for shorter, snappier, more visual posts?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s compare Reddits to those coming from the three sites giving NeB most referrals : Google search, MathOverflow and Wikipedia.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/reddit2.jpg"></p>
<p>This is the traffic coming from Reddit/math, as always the blue graph are the unique visitors, the yellow graph their average time on site, blue-scales to the left, yellow-scales to the right.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the same graph for <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google search</a>. The unique visitors/day fluctuate around 50 and their average time on site about 2 minutes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/google2.jpg"></p>
<p>The math-related search terms most used were this month : &#8216;functor of point approach&#8217;, &#8216;profinite integers&#8217; and &#8216;bost-connes sytem&#8217;.</p>
<p>More rewarding to me are referrals from <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/mathO1.jpg"></p>
<p>The number of visitors depends on whether the MathO-questions made it to the front-page (for example, the 80 visits on december 15, came from the <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/1909/what-are-dessins-denfants">What are dessins d’enfants?-topic</a> getting an extra comment that very day, and having two references to NeB-posts : <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-best-rejected-proposal-ever.html">The best rejected proposal ever</a> and <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/kleins-dessins-denfant-and-the-buckyball.html">Klein’s dessins d’enfant and the buckyball</a>), but even older MathO-topics give a few referrals a day, and these people sure take their time reading the posts (+ 5 minutes).</p>
<p>Other MathO-topics giving referrals this month were <a href="http://mathoverflow.net//questions/49151/most-intricate-and-most-beautiful-structures-in-mathematics">Most intricate and most beautiful structures in mathematics</a> (linking to <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/looking-for-f_un.html">Looking for F-un</a>), <a href="http://mathoverflow.net///questions/28496/what-should-be-learned-in-a-first-serious-schemes-course">What should be learned in a first serious schemes course?</a> (linking to <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/mumfords-treasure-map.html">Mumford’s treasure map</a> (btw. one of the most visited NeB-posts ever)), <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/14468/how-much-of-scheme-theory-can-you-visualize">How much of scheme theory can you visualize?</a> (linking again to Mumford&#8217;s treasure map) and <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/34699/approaches-to-riemann-hypothesis-using-methods-outside-number-theory">Approaches to Riemann hypothesis using methods outside number theory</a> (linking to the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-bost-connes-coset-space.html">Bost-Connes series</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s <a href="http://em.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/wikipedia1.jpg"></p>
<p>giving 5 to 10 referrals a day, with a pretty good time-on-site average (around 4 minutes, peaking to 12 minutes). It is rewarding to see NeB-posts referred to in as diverse Wikipedia-topics as &#8216;Fifteen puzzle&#8217;, &#8216;Field with one element&#8217;, &#8216;Evariste Galois&#8217;, &#8216;ADE classification&#8217;, &#8216;Monster group&#8217;, &#8216;Arithmetic topology&#8217;, &#8216;Dessin d&#8217;enfant&#8217;, &#8216;Groupoid&#8217;, &#8216;Belyi&#8217;s theorem&#8217;, &#8216;Modular group&#8217;, &#8216;Cubic surface&#8217;, &#8216;Esquisse d&#8217;un programme&#8217;, &#8216;N-puzzle&#8217;, &#8216;Shabat polynomial&#8217; and &#8216;Mathieu group&#8217;.</p>
<p>What lesson should be learned from all this data? Should I go for shorter, snappier and more visual posts, or should I focus on the small group of visitors taking their time reading through a longer post, and don&#8217;t care about the appallingly high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate">bounce rate</a> the others cause?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=237">Tanya Khovanova</a> I learned yesterday of <a href="http://www.onlinedegree.net/50-best-blogs-for-math-majors/">the 50 best math blogs for math-majors list</a> by OnlineDegree.net. Tanya&#8217;s blog got in 2nd (congrats!) and most of the blogs I sort of follow made it to the list : <a href="http://ncategory.wordpress.com/">the n-category cafe</a> (5), <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">not even wrong</a> (6), <a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/">Gowers</a> (12), <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/">Tao</a> (13), <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/">good math bad math</a> (14), <a href="http://rigtriv.wordpress.com/">rigorous trivialities</a> (18), <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/">the secret blogging seminar</a> (20), <a href="http://kea-monad.blogspot.com/">arcadian functor</a> (28) (btw. Kea&#8217;s new blog is now at <a href="http://pseudomonad.blogspot.com/">arcadian pseudofunctor</a>), etc., etc. . Sincere congrats to you all!</p>
<p>NeverEndingBooks didn&#8217;t make it to the list, and I can live with that. For reasons only relevant to myself, posting has slowed down over the last year and the most recent post dates back from february!</p>
<p>More puzzling to me was the fact that <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/fun/">F-un mathematics</a> got in place 26! OnlineDegree had this to say about F-un Math : &#8220;Any students studying math must bookmark this blog, which provides readers with a broad selection of undergraduate and graduate concerns, quotes, research, webcasts, and much, much more.&#8221; Well, personally I wouldn&#8217;t bother to bookmark this site as prospects for upcoming posts are virtually  inexistent&#8230;</p>
<p>As I am privy to both sites&#8217; admin-pages, let me explain my confusion by comparing their monthly hits. Here&#8217;s the full F-un history</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/historyFUN.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>After a flurry of activity in the fall of 2008, both posting and attendance rates dropped, and presently the site gets roughly 50 hits-a-day. Compare this to the (partial) NeB history</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/historyNeB.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>The whopping 45000 visits in january 2008 were (i think) deserved at the time as there was then a new post almost every other day. On the other hand, the green bars to the right are a mystery to me. It appears one is rewarded for not posting at all&#8230;</p>
<p>The only explanation I can offer is that perhaps more and more people are recovering from the late 2008-depression and do again enjoy reading blog-posts. Google then helps blogs having a larger archive (500 NeB-posts compared to about 20 genuine Fun-posts) to attract  a larger audience, even though the blog is dormant.</p>
<p>But this still doesn&#8217;t explain why FunMath made it to the top 50-list and NeB did not. Perhaps the fault is entirely mine and a consequence of a bad choice of blog-title. &#8216;NeverEndingBooks&#8217; does not ring like a math-blog, does it?</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m not going to change the title into something more math-related. NeverEndingBooks will be around for some time (unless my hard-disk breaks down). On the other hand, I plan to start something entirely new and learn from the mistakes I made over the past 6 years. Regulars of this blog will have a pretty good idea of the intended launch date, not?</p>
<p>Until then, my online activity will be limited to  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lievenlb">tweets</a>.</p>
