										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the first half of 1937, Andre Weil visited Princeton and introduced some of the postdocs present (notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_P._Boas_Jr.">Ralph Boas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John Tukey</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Smithies">Frank Smithies</a>) to <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/where-is-the-royal-poldavian-academy">Poldavian lore</a> and Bourbaki&#8217;s early work.</p>
<p>In 1935, Bourbaki succeeded (via father Cartan) to get his paper &#8220;Sur un théorème de Carathéodory et la mesure dans les espaces topologiques” published in the Comptes Rendus des Séances Hebdomadaires de l’Académie des Sciences.</p>
<p>Inspired by this, the Princeton gang decided to try to get a compilation of their <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/16-ways-to-capture-a-lion-in-1938">mathematical ways to catch a lion</a> in the American Mathematical Monthly, under the pseudonym <strong>H. Petard</strong>, and accompanied by a cover letter signed by another pseudonym, <strong>E. S. Pondiczery</strong>.</p>
<p>By the time the paper <a href="http://mathsci2.appstate.edu/~wmcb/Class/5620/ClassNotes/Math%20Theory%20of%20Big%20Game%20Hunting.pdf">&#8220;A contribution to the mathematical theory of big game hunting&#8221;</a> appeared, Boas and Smithies were in cambridge pursuing their postdoc work, and Boas reported back to Tukey: “Pétard’s paper is attracting attention here,” generating “subdued chuckles &#8230; in the Philosophical Library.”</p>
<p>On the left, Ralph Boas in &#8216;official&#8217; Pondiczery outfit &#8211; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lion-Hunting-Other-Mathematical-Pursuits/dp/088385323X">Photo Credit</a>.</p>

<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Bsocial3.jpg" width=100% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>The acknowledgment of the paper is in true  <a href="https://math.univ-angers.fr/~darniere/bourbaki.html">Bourbaki-canular</a> style.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The author desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to the <strong>Trivial Club of St. John&#8217;s College</strong>, Cambridge, England; to the <strong>M.I.T. chapter of the Society for Useless Research</strong>; to the <strong>F. o. P., of Princeton University</strong>; and to numerous individual contributors, known and unknown, conscious and unconscious.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Trivial Club of St. John&#8217;s College</strong> probably refers to the <a href="https://adamssociety.wordpress.com/">Adams Society</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge">St. John&#8217;s College</a> mathematics society. <a href=https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Smithies/">Frank Smithies</a> graduated from St. John&#8217;s in 1933, and began research on integral equations with Hardy. After his Ph. D., and on a Carnegie Fellowship and a St John&#8217;s College studentship, Smithies then spent two years at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, before returning back &#8216;home&#8217;.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/cambridge-spring-1939">previous post</a>, I assumed that Weil&#8217;s visit to Cambridge was linked to Trinity College. This should probably have been St. John&#8217;s College, his contact there being (apart from Smithies) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Newman">Max Newman</a>, a fellow of St. John&#8217;s. There are two letters from Weil (<a href="http://www.cdpa.co.uk/Newman/MHAN/view-item.php?Box=2&#038;SubBox=&#038;Folder=2&#038;SubFolder=&#038;Item=12&#038;SubItem=&#038;Page=1">summer 1939</a>, and <a href="http://www.cdpa.co.uk/Newman/MHAN/view-item.php?Box=2&#038;SubBox=&#038;Folder=3&#038;SubFolder=&#038;Item=2&#038;SubItem=&#038;Page=1">summer 1940</a>) in the <a href="http://www.cdpa.co.uk/Newman/MHAN/">Max Newman digital library</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/eagle-scanning-project">Eagle Scanning Project</a> is the online digital archive of The Eagle, the Journal of St. John&#8217;s College. Last time I wanted to find out what was going on, mathematically, in Cambridge in the spring of 1939. Now I know I just had to peruse the <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Eagle/Eagle%20Volumes/1930s/1939/Eagle_1939_Easter.pdf">Easter 1939</a> and <a href="https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Eagle/Eagle%20Volumes/1940s/1940/Eagle_1939_Michaelmas.pdf">Michaelmas 1939</a> volumes of the Eagle, focussing on the reports of the Adams Society.</p>
<p>In the period Andre Weil was staying in Cambridge, they had a Society Dinner in the Music Room on March 9th, a talk about calculating machines (with demonstration!) on April 27th, and the Annual Business Meeting on May 11th, just two days before their punting trip to Grantchester,</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>The <strong>M.I.T. chapter of the Society for Useless Research</strong> is a different matter. The &#8216;Useless Research&#8217; no doubt refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasensory_perception#:~:text=Extrasensory%20perception%20or%20ESP%2C%20also,by%20Duke%20University%20psychologist%20J.%20B.">Extrasensory Perception, or ESP</a>. Pondiczery&#8217;s initials E. S. were chosen with a future pun in mind, as Tukey said in a later interview:</p>
<p>“Well, the hope was that at some point Ersatz Stanislaus Pondiczery at the Royal Institute of Poldavia was going to be able to sign something ESP RIP.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was the Princeton connection to ESP research?</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks_Rhine">Joseph Banks Rhine</a> conducted experiments at Duke University in the early 1930s on ESP using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards">Zener cards</a>. Amongst his test-persons was Hubert Pearce, who scored an overall 40% success rate, whereas chance would have been 20%.</p>
<p><center><br />

Pearce and Joseph Banks Rhine (1932) &#8211; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks_Rhine">Photo Credit</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>In 1936, W. S. Cox tried to repeat Rhine&#8217;s experiment at Princeton University but failed. Cox concluded &#8220;There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the &#8216;average man&#8217; or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to the &#8216;MIT chapter of the society for useless research&#8217;, a chapter usually refers to a fraternity at a University, but I couldn&#8217;t find a single one on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_fraternities,_sororities,_and_ILGs">list of MIT fraternities</a> involved in ESP, now or back in the late 1930s.</p>
<p>However, to my surprise I found that there is a <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/01/15/MITs-Archive-of-Useless-Research/9740600843600/">MIT Archive of Useless Research</a>, six boxes full of amazing books, pamphlets and other assorted &#8216;literature&#8217; compiled between 1900 and 1940.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/721">Albert G. Ingalls pseudoscience collection</a> (its official name) comprises collections of books and pamphlets assembled by Albert G. Ingalls while associate editor of Scientific American, and given to the MIT Libraries in 1940. Much of the material rejects contemporary theories of physical sciences, particularly theoretical and planetary physics; a smaller portion builds upon contemporary science and explores hypotheses not yet accepted.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether any ESP research is included in the collection, nor whether Boas and Tukey were aware of its existence in 1938, but it sure makes a good story.</p>
<p>The final riddle, the <strong>F. o. P., of Princeton University</strong> is an easy one. Of course, this refers to the &#8220;Friends of Pondiczery&#8221;, the circle of people in Princeton who knew of the existence of their very own Bourbaki.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/lionhunting1938.jpg" align=right width=50% >A classic among mathematical jokes is the paper in the August/September 1938 issue of the American Mathematical Monthly &#8220;A contribution to the mathematical theory of big game hunting&#8221; by one Hector Petard of Princeton who would marry, one year later, Nicolas Bourbaki&#8217;s daughter Betti.</p>
<p><span style="display:none">claimtoken-511b561b7a5a2</span></p>
<p>There are two main sources of information on the story behind this paper. There are Frank Smithies&#8217; &#8220;Reminiscences  of Ralph Boas&#8221; in the book <a href="http://books.google.be/books/about/Lion_Hunting_Other_Mathematical_Pursuits.html?id=f-EWj5WtQHgC&#038;redir_esc=y">Lion Hunting &#038; Other Mathematical Pursuits</a> and the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mudd/finding_aids/mathoral/pmc41.htm">transcript of an interview</a> with John Tukey and Albert Tucker at Princeton University on 11 April 1984, part of the oral-history project on <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~mudd/finding_aids/mathoral/pm02.htm">the Princeton mathematics community in the 1930s</a>.</p>
<p>Smithies recalls being part of a lively group of people in Princeton during the academic year 1937/38 including Arthur Brown, Ralph Traber, Lyman Spitzer, Hugh Dowker, John Olmsted, Henry Walman, George Barnard, John Tukey, Mort Kanner (a physicist), Dick Jameson (a linguist) and Ralph Boas. Smithies writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;At some time that winter we were told about the mathematical methods for lion-hunting that have been devised in Gottingen, and several of us came up with new ones; who invented which method is now lost to memory. Ralph (Boas) and I decided to write up all the methods known to us, with a view to publication, conforming as closely as we could to the usual style of a mathematical paper. We choose H. Petard as a pseudonym (&#8220;the engineer, hoist with his own petard&#8221;; Hamlet, Act III, Scene IV), and sent the paper to the Americal Mathematical Monthly, over the signature of E. S. Pondiczery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pondiczery was Princeton&#8217;s answer to Nicolas Bourbaki, and in the interview John Tukey recalls from (sometimes failing) memory:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the hope was that at some point Ersatz Stanislaus Pondiczery at the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/where-is-the-royal-poldavian-academy">Royal Institute of Poldavia</a> was going to be able to sign something ESP RIP. Then there&#8217;s the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-wedding-invitation-that-nearly-killed-andre-weil">wedding invitation done by the Bourbakis</a>. It was for the marriage of Betti Bourbaki and Pondiczery. It was a formal wedding invitation with a long Latin sentence, most of which was mathematical jokes, three quarters of which you could probably decipher. Pondiczery even wrote a paper under a pseudonym, namely &#8220;The Mathematical Theory of Big Game Hunting&#8221; by H. Petard, which appeared in the Monthly. There were also a few other papers by Pondiczery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Andrew Tucker then tells the story of the paper&#8217;s acceptance:</p>
<p>&#8220;Moulton, the editor of the Monthly at that time, wrote to me saying that he had this paper and the envelope was postmarked Princeton and he assumed that it was done by some people in math at Princeton. He said he would very much like to publish the paper, but there was a firm policy against publishing anything anonymous. He asked if I, or somebody else that he knew and could depend on, would tell him that the authorship would be revealed if for any reason it became legally necessary. I did not know precisely who they were, but I knew that John [Tukey] was one of them. He seemed to be in the thick of such things. John agreed that I could accept Moulton&#8217;s terms. I sent a letter with this assurance to Moulton and he went ahead and published it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s great fun trying to decode some of the puns contained in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-wedding-invitation-that-nearly-killed-andre-weil.html">Betti Bourbaki&#8217;s wedding invitation</a>. Below a photograph, taken on May 13th 1939, of three of the practical jokers (from left to right : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_P._Boas,_Jr.">Ralph Boas</a>, <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Smithies.html">Frank Smithies</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Weil">Andre Weil</a>), the others were <a href="http://www.numbertheory.org/obituaries/OTHERS/chabauty/chabauty2.html">Claude Chabauty</a>, Weil&#8217;s wife Eveline and Louis Bouckaert (from Louvain).</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/RedLion.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>Part of this picture is on the front cover of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lion-Hunting-Other-Mathematical-Pursuits/dp/088385323X/">Lion Hunting &amp; other Mathematical Pursuits</a>. This book clarifies the &#8216;Secrétaire de l&#8217;Oevre du Sou du Lion&#8217;-phrase as well as some of the names on the card.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Bourbaki-hoax, a group of postdoctoral fellows visiting Princeton University in 1937-1938 (Boas, Smithies and John Tuckey) published their inventions, allegedly devised by Hector Pétard (aka &#8216;H(oist) W(ith) O(wn) Petard&#8217; after the Shakespeare line &#8220;For &#8217;tis the sport to have the engineer, hoist with his own petard&#8230;&#8221; Hamlet act III scene IV) who was writing under the pseudonym of E.S. Pondiczery. Pétard&#8217;s existence was asserted in the paper &#8220;A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Big-Game Hunting&#8221;  Amer. Math. Monthly 45 (1938) 446-447.</p>
<p>Smithies recalls the spring 1939 period in Cambridge as follows : &#8220;The climax of the academic year, as far as we were concerned, came in the Easter term. André Weil, Claude Chabauty, and Louis Bouckaert (from Louvain) were all in Cambridge, and the proposal was mooted that a marriage should be arranged between Bourbaki&#8217;s daughter Betti and Hector Pétard; the marriage announcement was duly printed in the canonical French style &#8211; on it Pétard was described as the ward of Ersatz Stanislas Pondiczery &#8211; and it was circulated to the friends of both parties. A couple of weeks later the Weils, Louis Bouckaert, Max Krook (a South African astrophysicist), Ralph and myself made a river excursion to Grantchester by punt and canoe to have tea at the Red Lion; there is a photograph of Ralph and myself, with our triumphantly captured lion between us and André Weil looking benevolently on.&#8221;</p>
<p>From this and the date of the photograph (May 13th 1939) one can conclude that the marriage-card was drawn up around mid april 1939. As weddings tend to follow their announcement by a couple of months, this contradicts the following passage from <a href="http://portail.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/hcms_004.pdf">Notice sur la Vie et l &#8216;oeuvre de Nicolas Bourbaki</a> by an unidentified author :</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/wedding1938.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>&#8220;Nominated as Privat-Dozent at the University of Dorpat in 1913, he (that is, N. Bourbaki) married two years later; a single girl, Betti, married in 1938 to the Lion hunter H. Pétard, was born out of this marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then, when was the Bourbaki-Pétard wedding scheduled? Surely, a wedding announcement should provide that information. Here&#8217;s the relevant part :</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/weddingdate.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>&#8220;The trivial isomorphism (aka the sacrament of matrimony) will be given to them by P. Adic, of the Diophantine Order, at the Principal Cohomology of the Universal Variety, <strong>the 3 Cartember, year VI, at the usual hour</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my guess : the first Bourbaki-meeting took place  December 10th 1934. Actually, it was a &#8216;proto-Bourbaki-meeting&#8217;, but nevertheless founding members such as [<a href="http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Delsarte.html">Jean Delsarte</a> counted 1934 as the first Bourbaki year as is clear from the &#8216;Remarque&#8217; at the top of his <a href="http://portail.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/delta_001.pdf">notes of the first meeting</a> : 34+25=59, trying to figure out when the 25-year festivity was going to be held &#8230;</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/firstBourbaki.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>Thus, if 1934 is year 1 of the Bourbaki-calender, year VI should be 1939. The notules also give a hint of &#8216;the usual hour&#8217;. In the 1934-1940 period, the Bourbakis met twice a month before the monday-afternoon seminar, at 12 o&#8217;clock sharp, the &#8216;sacred hour&#8217;, for a meeting over lunch.</p>
<p>Remains the &#8216;Cartembre&#8217;-puzzle. We know &#8216;Septembre (7), Novembre (9), Decembre (10)&#8217; so if &#8216;Cart&#8217; is short for &#8216;Quatre&#8217; (4), Cartembre might be June. I guess the wedding was scheduled to be held on <strong>June 3rd, 1939 at 12h</strong>.</p>
<p>It fits with the date the announcement was drawn up and June 3rd, 1939 sure enough was a saturday, the &#8216;canonical&#8217; day for a wedding. Remains the problem of the wedding <strong>place</strong>. Suggestions anyone?</p>
