										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here, <em>MaMuTh</em> stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_and_mathematics">Mathematical Music Theory</a> which analyses the pitch, timing, and structure of works of music.</p>
<p>The <em>Elephant</em> is the nickname for the &#8216;bible&#8217; of topos theory, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sketches-Elephant-Theory-Compendium-Oxford/dp/019852496X">Sketches of an Elephant: A Topos Theory Compendium</a>, a two (three?) volume book, written by Peter Johnstone.</p>
<p>How can we get as quickly as possible from the MaMuth to the Elephant, musical illiterates such as myself?</p>
<p>What Mamuth-ers call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class">pitch class</a> (sounds that are a whole number of octaves apart), is for us a residue modulo $12$, as an octave is usually divided into twelve (half)tones.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll just denote them by numbers from $0$ to $11$, or view them as the vertices of a regular $12$-gon, and forget the funny names given to them, as there are several such encodings, and we don&#8217;t know a $G$ from a $D\#$.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>Our regular $12$-gon has exactly $24$ symmetries. Twelve rotations, which they call <em>transpositions</em>, given by the affine transformations<br />
\[<br />
T_k~:~x \mapsto x+k~\text{mod}~12 \]<br />
and twelve reflexions, which they call <em>involutions</em>, given by<br />
\[<br />
I_k~:~x \mapsto -x+k~\text{mod}~12 \]<br />
What for us is the dihedral group $D_{12}$ (all symmetries of the $12$-gon), is for them the $T/I$-group (for transpositions/involutions).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move from individual notes (or pitch classes) to chords (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(music)">triads</a>), that is, three notes played together.</p>
<p>Not all triples of notes sound nice when played together, that&#8217;s why the most commonly played chords are among the <em>major</em> and <em>minor</em> triads.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_chord">major triad</a> is an ordered triple of elements from $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ of the form<br />
\[<br />
(n,n+4~\text{mod}~12,n+7~\text{mod}~12) \]<br />
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_chord">minor triad</a> is an ordered triple of the form<br />
\[<br />
(n,n+3~\text{mod}~12,n+7~\text{mod}~12) \]<br />
where the first entry $n$ is called the <em>root</em> of the triad (or chord) and its funny name is then also the name of that chord.</p>
<p>For us, it is best to view a triad as an inscribed triangle in our regular $12$-gon. The triangles of major and minor triads have edges of different lengths, a small one, a middle, and a large one.</p>
<p>Starting from the root, and moving clockwise, we encounter in a major chord-triangle first the middle edge, then the small edge, and finally the large edge. For a minor chord-triangle, we have first the small edge, then the middle one, and finally the large edge.</p>
<p>On the left, two major triads, one with root $0$, the other with root $6$. On the right, two minor triads, also with roots $0$ and $6$.</p>

</center></p>
<p>(Btw. if you are interested in the full musical story, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://alpof.wordpress.com/">alpof blog</a> by Alexandre Popoff, from which the above picture is taken.)</p>
<p>Clearly, there are $12$ major triads (one for each root), and $12$ minor triads.</p>
<p>From the shape of the triad-triangles it is also clear that rotations (transpositions) send major triads to major triads (and minors to minors), and that reflexions (involutions) interchange major with minor triads.</p>
<p>That is, the dihedral group $D_{12}$ (or if you prefer the $T/I$-group) acts on the set of $24$ major and minor triads, and this action is transitive (an element stabilising a triad-triangle must preserve its type (so is a rotation) and its root (so must be the identity)).</p>
<p>Can we hear the action of the very special group element $T_6$ (the unique non-trivial central element of $D_{12}$) on the chords?</p>
<p>This action is not only the transposition by three full tones, but also a point-reflexion with respect to the center of the $12$-gon (see two examples in the picture above). This point reflexion can be compositionally meaningful to refer to two very different upside-down worlds.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://alpof.wordpress.com/2020/12/06/its-t6-day/">It&#8217;s $T_6$-day</a>, Alexandre Popoff gives several examples. Here&#8217;s one of them, the Ark theme in Indiana Jones â€“ Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gFDM7JGHGYo?start=160" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;The $T_6$ transformation is heard throughout the map room scene (in particular at 2:47 in the video): that the ark is a dreadful object from a very different world is well rendered by the $T_6$ transposition, with its inherent tritone and point reflection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on in the direction of the Elephant.</p>
<p>We saw that the only affine map of the form $x \mapsto \pm x + k$ fixing say the major $0$-triad $(0,4,7)$ is the identity map.</p>
<p>But, we can ask for the collection of all affine maps $x \mapsto a x + b$ fixing this major $0$-triad <em>set-wise</em>, that is, such that<br />
\[<br />
\{ b, 4a+b~\text{mod}~12, 7a+b~\text{mod}~2 \} \subseteq \{ 0,4,7 \} \]</p>
<p>A quick case-by-case analysis shows that there are just eight such maps: the identity and the constant maps<br />
\[<br />
x \mapsto x,~x \mapsto 0,~x \mapsto 4, ~x \mapsto 7 \]<br />
and the four maps<br />
\[<br />
\underbrace{x \mapsto 3x+7}_a,~\underbrace{x \mapsto 8x+4}_b,~x \mapsto 9x+4,~x \mapsto 4x \]</p>
<p>Compositions of such maps again preserve the set $\{ 0,4,7 \}$ so they form a <em>monoid</em>, and a quick inspection with GAP learns that $a$ and $b$ generate this monoid.</p>
<p><code><br />
gap> a:=Transformation([10,1,4,7,10,1,4,7,10,1,4,7]);;<br />
gap> b:=Transformation([12,8,4,12,8,4,12,8,4,12,8,4]);;<br />
gap> gens:=[a,b];;<br />
gap> T:=Monoid(gens);<br />
<transformation monoid of degree 12 with 2 generators>
gap> Size(T);<br />
8<br />
</code></p>
<p>The monoid $T$ is the <em>triadic monoid</em> of Thomas Noll&#8217;s paper <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134.5669&#038;rep=rep1&#038;type=pdf">The topos of triads</a>.</p>
<p>The monoid $T$ can be seen as a one-object category (with endomorphisms the elements of $T$). The corresponding presheaf topos is then the category of all sets equipped with a right $T$-action.</p>
<p>Actually, Noll considers just one such presheaf (and its sub-presheaves) namely $\mathcal{F}=\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ with the action of $T$ by affine maps described before.</p>
<p>He is interested in the sheafifications of these presheaves with respect to Grothendieck topologies, so we have to describe those.</p>
<p>For any monoid category, the subobject classifier $\Omega$ is the set of all right ideals in the monoid.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://www.gap-system.org/Packages/sgpviz.html">GAP sgpviz package</a> we can draw its Cayley graph (red coloured vertices are idempotents in the monoid, the blue vertex is the identity map).</p>
<p><code><br />
gap> DrawCayleyGraph(T);<br />
</code></p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/mamuth3.png" width=100% /><br />
</center></p>
<p>The elements of $T$ (vertices) which can be connected by oriented paths (in both ways) in the Cayley graph, such as here $\{ 2,4 \}$, $\{ 3,7 \}$ and $\{ 5,6,8 \}$, will generate the same right ideal in $T$, so distinct right ideals are determined by unidirectional arrows, such as from $1$ to $2$ and $3$ or from $\{ 2,4 \}$ to $5$, or from $\{ 3,7 \}$ to $6$.</p>
<p>This gives us that $\Omega$ consists of the following six elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>$0 = \emptyset$</li>
<li>$C = \{ 5,6,8 \} = a.T \wedge b.T$</li>
<li>$L = \{ 2,4,5,6,8 \}=a.T$</li>
<li>$R = \{ 3,7,5,6,8 \}=b.T$</li>
<li>$P = \{ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \}=a.T \vee b.T$</li>
<li>$1 = T$</li>
</ul>
<p>As a subobject classifier $\Omega$ is itself a presheaf, so wat is the action of the triad monoid $T$ on it? For all $A \in \Omega$, and $s \in T$ the action is given by $A.s = \{ t \in T | s.t \in A \}$ and it can be read off from the Cayley-graph.</p>
<p>$\Omega$ is a Heyting algebra of which the inclusions, and logical operations can be summarised in the picture below, using the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/hexboards-and-heytings">Hexboards and Heytings-post</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/hexheyting3.png" width=60% /><br />
</center></p>
<p>In this case, Grothendieck topologies coincide with Lawvere-Tierney topologies, which come from closure operators $j~:~\Omega \rightarrow \Omega$ which are order-increasing, idempotent, and compatible with the $T$-action and with the $\wedge$, that is,</p>
<ul>
<li>if $A \leq B$, then $j(A) \leq j(B)$</li>
<li>$j(j(A)) = j(A)$</li>
<li>$j(A).t=j(A.t)$</li>
<li>$j(A \wedge B) = j(A) \wedge j(B)$</li>
</ul>
<p>Colouring all cells with the same $j$-value alike, and remaining cells $A$ with $j(A)=A$ coloured yellow, we have six such closure operations $j$, that is, Grothendieck topologies.</p>

<p>The triadic monoid $T$ acts via affine transformations on the set of pitch classes $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ and we&#8217;ve defined it such that it preserves the notes $\{ 0,4,7 \}$ of the major $(0,4,7)$-chord, that is, $\{ 0,4,7 \}$ is a subobject of $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ in the topos of $T$-sets.</p>
<p>The point of the subobject classifier $\Omega$ is that morphisms to it classify subobjects, so there must be a $T$-equivariant map $\chi$ making the diagram commute (vertical arrows are the natural inclusions)<br />
\[<br />
\xymatrix{\{ 0,4,7 \} \ar[r] \ar[d] &#038; 1 \ar[d] \\ \mathbb{Z}_{12} \ar[r]^{\chi} &#038; \Omega} \]</p>
<p>What does the morphism $\chi$ do on the other pitch classes? Well, it send an element $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{12} = \{ 1,2,\dots,12=0 \}$ to</p>
<ul>
<li>$1$ iff $k \in \{ 0,4,7 \}$</li>
<li>$P$ iff $a(k)$ and $b(k)$ are in $\{ 0,4,7 \}$</li>
<li>$L$ iff $a(k) \in \{ 0,4,7 \}$ but $b(k)$ is not</li>
<li>$R$ iff $b(k) \in \{ 0,4,7 \}$ but $a(k)$ is not</li>
<li>$C$ iff neither $a(k)$ nor $b(k)$ is in $\{ 0,4,7 \}$</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that $a$ and $b$ are the transformations (images of $(1,2,\dots,12)$)<br />
<code><br />
a:=Transformation([10,1,4,7,10,1,4,7,10,1,4,7]);;<br />
b:=Transformation([12,8,4,12,8,4,12,8,4,12,8,4]);;<br />
</code><br />
so we see that</p>
<ul>
<li>$0,1,4$ are mapped to $1$</li>
<li>$3$ is mapped to $P$</li>
<li>$8,11$ are mapped to $L$</li>
<li>$1,6,9,10$ are mapped to $R$</li>
<li>$2,5$ are mapped to $C$</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we can compute the sheafification of the sub-presheaf $\{ 0,4,7 \}$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ with respect to a Grothendieck topology $j$: it consists of the set of those $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{12}$ such that $j(\chi(k)) = 1$.</p>
<p>The musically interesting Grothendieck topologies are $j_P, j_L$ and $j_R$ with corresponding sheaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>For $j_P$ we get the sheaf $\{ 0,3,4,7 \}$ which Mamuth-ers call a <em>Major-Minor Mixture</em> as these are the notes of both the major and minor $0$-triads</li>
<li>For $j_L$ we get $\{ 0,3,4,7,8,11 \}$ which is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexatonic_scale">Hexatonic scale</a> (six notes), here they are the notes of the major and minor $0,~4$ and $8$-triads</li>
<li>For $j_R$ we get $\{ 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10 \}$ which is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octatonic_scale">Octatonic scale</a> (eight notes), here they are the notes of the major and minor $0,~3,~6$ and $9$-triads</li>
</ul>
<p>We could have played the same game starting with the three notes of any other major triad.</p>
<p>Those in the know will have noticed that so far I&#8217;ve avoided another incarnation of the dihedral $D_{12}$ group in music, namely the $PLR$-group, which explains the notation for the elements of the subobject classifier $\Omega$, but this post is already way too long.</p>
