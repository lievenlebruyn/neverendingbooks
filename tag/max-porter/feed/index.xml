										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this series I’ll mention some books I found entertaining, stimulating or comforting during these Corona times. Read them at your own risk.</p>

</center></p>
<p>In an attempt to raise the level of this series, I tried to get through the latest hype in high-brow literature: <a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/books/fiction/9780571366514-the-death-of-francis-bacon.html">The Death of Francis Bacon</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Porter_(writer)">Max Porter</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an extremely thin book, just 43 pages long, hardly a novella. My Kindle said I should be able to read it in less than an hour.</p>
<p>Boy, did that turn out differently. I&#8217;m a week into this book, and still struggling.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e4/Three_Studies_for_a_Self-Portrait.jpg" width=100%><br />
Chapter 4(?) :<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Studies_for_a_Self-Portrait,_(Bacon,_1979)">Three Studies for a Self-Portrait, (Francis Bacon, 1979)</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>A few minutes into the book I realised I didn&#8217;t know the first thing about Bacon&#8217;s death, and that the book was not going to offer me that setting. Fortunately, there&#8217;s always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(artist)#Death">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While holidaying in Madrid in 1992, Bacon was admitted to the Handmaids of Maria, a private clinic, where he was cared for by Sister Mercedes. His chronic asthma, which had plagued him all his life, had developed into a more severe respiratory condition and he could not talk or breathe very well.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Fine, at least I now knew where &#8220;Darling mama, sister oh Dios, Mercedes&#8221; (p.7) came from, and why every chapter ended with &#8220;Intenta descansar&#8221; (try to rest).</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m somewhat familiar with Bacon&#8217;s paintings, I did know too little about his life to follow the clues sprinkled throughout the book. Fortunately, there&#8217;s this excellent documentary about his life: &#8220;Francis Bacon: A Brush with Violence&#8221; (2017)</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MgrO5za0lSY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Okay, now I could place many of the characters visiting Bacon, either physically sitting on the chair he offers at the start of each chapter (&#8220;Take a seat why don&#8217;t you&#8221;), or merely as memories playing around in his head. It&#8217;s a bit unclear to me.</p>
<p>Then, there&#8217;s the structure of the book. Each of the seven chapters has as title the dimensions of a painting:</p>
<ul>
<li>One: Oil on canvas, 60 x 46 1/2 in.</li>
<li>Two: Oil on canvas, 65 1/2 x 56 in.</li>
<li>Three: Oil on canvas, 65 x 56 in.</li>
<li>Four: Oil on canvas, 14 x 12 in.</li>
<li>Five: Oil on canvas, 78 x 58 in.</li>
<li>Six: Oil on canvas, 37 x 29 in.</li>
<li>Seven: Oil on canvas, 77 x 52 in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being the person I am, I hoped that if I could track down the corresponding Bacon paintings, I might begin to understand the corresponding chapter. Fortunately, Wikipedia provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paintings_by_Francis_Bacon">List of paintings by Francis Bacon</a>.</p>
<p>Many of Bacon&#8217;s paintings are triptychs, and the dimensions refer to those of a single panel. So, even if I found the correct triptych I still had to figure out which of the three panels corresponds to the chapter.</p>
<p>And often, there are several possible candidates. The 14 x 12 in. panel-format Bacon often used for studies for larger works. So, chapter 4 might as well refer to his studies for a self portrait (see above), or to the three studies for a portrait of Henrietta Moraes:</p>

Chapter 4(?) : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Studies_for_a_Portrait_of_Henrietta_Moraes">Three studies for portrait of Henrietta Moraes (1963)</a><br />
</center></p>
<p>Here are some of my best guesses:</p>

<img decoding="async" src="https://www.francis-bacon.com/system/files/images/63-13%20FB%20RGB.jpg" width=50%><br />
Chapter 3(?): <a href="https://www.francis-bacon.com/artworks/paintings/portrait-henrietta-moraes">Portrait of Henrietta Moraes (1963)</a><br />

</center></p>
<p>No doubt, I&#8217;m just on a wild goose chase here. Probably, Max Porter is merely using existing dimensions of Bacon paintings for blank canvases to smear his words on, as explained in this erudite ArtReview <a href="https://artreview.com/what-does-it-mean-to-write-a-painting-on-max-porter-the-death-of-francis-bacon-review/">What Does It Mean To Write a Painting?</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the writer Max Porter himself, explaining his book.</p>
