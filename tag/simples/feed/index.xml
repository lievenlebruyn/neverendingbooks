					<description><![CDATA[In his paper Cyclotomy and analytic geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$ Yuri I. Manin sketches and compares four approaches to the definition of a geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$,&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/absolutpoint.jpg" align=left hspace=10> In his paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1564">Cyclotomy and analytic geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$</a> Yuri I. Manin sketches and compares four approaches to the definition of a geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$, the elusive field with one element.</p>
<p>He writes : &#8220;Preparing a colloquium talk in Paris, I have succumbed to the temptation to associate them with some dominant trends in the history of art.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/looking-for-f_un.html">Remember</a>  that the search for the absolute point $\pmb{spec}(\mathbb{F}_1)$ originates from the observation that $\pmb{spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, the set of all prime numbers together with $0$, is too large to serve as the terminal object in Grothendieck&#8217;s theory of commutative schemes. The last couple of years have seen a booming industry of proposals, to the extent that Javier Lopez Pena and Oliver Lorscheid decided they had to draw a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0069">map of $\mathbb{F}_1$-land</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/F1land.jpg"></p>
<p>Manin only discusses the colored proposals (TV=Toen-Vaquie, M=Deitmar, S=Soule and $\Lambda$=Borger) and compares them to these art-history trends.</p>
<p><strong>Toen and Vaquie : Abstract Expressionism</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/abstactexpressionism.jpg"></p>
<p>In <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0509684">Under $\pmb{spec}(\mathbb{Z})$</a> Bertrand Toen and Michel Vaquie argue that geometry over $\mathbb{F}_1$ is a special case of algebraic geometry over a symmetric monoidal category, taking the simplest example namely sets and direct products. Probably because of its richness and abstract nature, Manin associates this approach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism">Abstract Expressionism</a> (a.o. Karel Appel, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning).</p>
<p><strong>Deitmar : Minimalism</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/minimalism.jpg"></p>
<p>Because monoids are the &#8216;commutative algebras&#8217; in sets with direct products, an equivalent proposal is that of Anton Deitmar in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0404185">Schemes over $\mathbb{F}_1$</a> in which the basic affine building blocks are spectra of monoids, topological spaces whose points are submonoids satisfying a primeness property. Because Deitmar himself calls this approach a &#8216;minimalistic&#8217; one it is only natural to associate to it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">Minimalism</a> where the work is stripped down to its most fundamental features. Prominent artists associated with this movement include Donald Judd, John McLaughlin, Agnes Martin, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, and Frank Stella.</p>
<p><strong>Soule : Critical Realism</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/realism.jpg"></p>
<p>in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/fun/library/Soule2004.pdf">Les varietes sur le corps a un element</a> Christophe Soule defines varieties over $\mathbb{F}_1$ to be specific schemes $X$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ together with a form of &#8216;descent data&#8217; as well as an additional $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, morally the algebra of functions on the real place. Because of this Manin associates to it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_realism">Critical Realism</a> in philosophy. There are also &#8216;realism&#8217; movements in art such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_realism">American Realism</a> (o.a. Edward Hopper and John Sloan).</p>
<p><strong>Borger : Futurism</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/futurism.jpg"></p>
<p>James Borger&#8217;s paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3146">Lambda-rings and the field with one element</a> offers a totally new conception of the descent data from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{F}_1$, namely that of a $\lambda$-ring in the sense of Grothendieck. Because Manin expects this approach to lead to progress in the field, he connects it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism">Futurism</a>, an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a tiny problem illustrating our limited knowledge of finite fields : &#8220;Imagine an infinite queue of Knights $&#123; K_1,K_2,K_3,\ldots &#125; $, waiting to be seated at the unit-circular table. The master of ceremony (that is, you) must give Knights $K_a $ and $K_b $ a place at an odd root of unity, say $\omega_a $ and $\omega_b $, such that the seat at the odd root of unity $\omega_a \times \omega_b $ must be given to the Knight $K_{a \otimes b} $, where $a \otimes b $ is the Nim-multiplication of $a $ and $b $. Which place would you offer to Knight $K_{16} $, or Knight $K_n $,  or, if you&#8217;re into ordinals, Knight $K_{\omega} $?&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this have to do with finite fields? Well, consider the simplest of all finite field $\mathbb{F}_2 = &#123; 0,1 &#125; $ and consider its algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $. Last year, we&#8217;ve run a <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/on2-transfinite-number-hacking.html">series starting here</a>, identifying the field $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $, following John H. Conway in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Numbers_and_Games">ONAG</a>, with the set of all ordinals smaller than $\omega^{\omega^{\omega}} $, given the Nim addition and multiplication. I know that ordinal numbers may be intimidating at first, so let&#8217;s just restrict to ordinary natural numbers for now. The Nim-addition of two numbers $n \oplus m $ can be calculated by writing the numbers n and m in binary form and add them without carrying. For example, $9 \oplus 1 = 1001+1 = 1000 = 8 $. Nim-multiplication is slightly more complicated and is best expressed using the so-called Fermat-powers $F_n = 2^{2^n} $. We then demand that $F_n \otimes m = F_n \times m $ whenever $m &lt; F_n $ and $F_n \otimes F_n = \frac{3}{2}F_n $. Distributivity wrt. $\oplus $ can then be used to calculate arbitrary Nim-products. For example, $8 \otimes 3 = (4 \otimes 2) \otimes (2 \oplus 1) = (4 \otimes 3) \oplus (4 \otimes 2) = 12 \oplus 8 = 4 $. Conway&#8217;s remarkable result asserts that the ordinal numbers, equipped with Nim addition and multiplication, form an algebraically closed field of characteristic two. The closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $ is identified with the subfield of all ordinals smaller than $\omega^{\omega^{\omega}} $. For those of you who don&#8217;t feel like going transfinite, the subfield $~(\mathbb{N},\oplus,\otimes) $ is identified with the quadratic closure of $\mathbb{F}_2 $.</p>
<p>The connection between $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $ and the odd roots of unity has been advocated by Alain Connes in his talk before a general public at the IHES : “L’ange de la géométrie, le diable de l’algèbre et le corps à un élément” (the angel of geometry, the devil of algebra and the field with one element). He describes its content briefly in this YouTube-video</p>
<p><object width="340" height="209"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/obEi7BkR3V0&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/obEi7BkR3V0&#038;hl=en&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="340" height="209"></embed></object></p>
<p>At first it was unclear to me which &#8216;coupling-problem&#8217; Alain meant, but this has been clarified in his paper together with Caterina Consani <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3537">Characteristic one, entropy and the absolute point</a>. The non-zero elements of $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $ can be identified with the set of all odd roots of unity. For, if x is such a unit, it belongs to a finite subfield of the form $\mathbb{F}_{2^n} $ for some n, and, as the group of units of any finite field is cyclic, x is an element of order $2^n-1 $. Hence, $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}- &#123; 0 &#125; $ can be identified with the set of $2^n-1 $-roots of unity, with $e^{2 \pi i/n} $ corresponding to a generator of the unit-group. So, all elements of $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $ correspond to an odd root of unity. The observation that we get indeed all odd roots of unity may take you a couple of seconds (( If m is odd, then (2,m)=1 and so 2 is a unit in the finite cyclic group $~(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})^* $ whence $2^n = 1 (mod~m) $, so the m-roots of unity lie within those of order $2^n-1 $ )).</p>
<p>Assuming we succeed in fixing a one-to-one correspondence between the non-zero elements of $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $ and the odd roots of unity $\mu_{odd} $ respecting multiplication, how can we recover the addition on $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $? Well, here&#8217;s Alain&#8217;s coupling function, he ties up an element x of the algebraic closure to the element s(x)=x+1 (and as we are in characteristic two, this is an involution, so also the element tied up to x+1 is s(x+1)=(x+1)+1=x. The clue being that multiplication together with the coupling map s allows us to compute any sum of two elements as $x+y=x \times s(\frac{y}{x}) = x \times (\frac{y}{x}+1) $.<br />
For example, all information about the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^4} $ is encoded in this identification with the 15-th roots of unity, together with the pairing s depicted as</p>
<p>
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/16field1.jpg" style="float:center;">
</p>
<p>Okay, we now have two identifications of the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}_2} $ : the smaller ordinals equipped with Nim addition and Nim multiplication and the odd roots of unity with complex-multiplication and the Connes-coupling s. The question we started from asks for a general recipe to identify these two approaches.</p>
<p>To those of you who are convinced that finite fields (LOL, even characteristic two!) are objects far too trivial to bother thinking about : as far as I know, NOBODY knows how to do this explicitly, even restricting the ordinals to merely the natural numbers!</p>
<p>Please feel challenged! To get you started, I&#8217;ll show you how to place the first 15 Knights and give you a  procedure (though far from explicit) to continue. Here&#8217;s the Nim-picture compatible with that above</p>
<p>
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/16field2.jpg" style="float:center;">
</p>
<p>To verify this, and to illustrate the general strategy, I&#8217;d better hand you the Nim-tables of the first 16 numbers. Here they are</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/nimaddition.jpg" style="float:center;"> </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/nimmultiplication.jpg" style="float:center;"> </p>
<p>It is known that the finite subfields of $~(\mathbb{N},\oplus,\otimes) $ are precisely the sets of numbers smaller than the Fermat-powers $F_n $. So, the first one is all numbers smaller than $F_1=4 $ (check!). The smallest generator of the multiplicative group (of order 3) is 2, so we take this to correspond to the unit-root $e^{2 \pi i/3} $. The next subfield are all numbers smaller than $F_2 = 16 $ and its multiplicative group has order 15. Now, choose the smallest integer k which generates this group, compatible with the condition that $k^{\otimes 5}=2 $. Verify that this number is 4 and that this forces the identification and coupling given above.</p>
<p>The next finite subfield would consist of all natural numbers smaller than $F_3=256 $. Hence, in this field we are looking for the smallest number k generating the multiplicative group of order 255 satisfying the extra condition that $k^{\otimes 17}=4 $ which would fix an identification at that level. Then, the next level would be all numbers smaller than $F_4=65536 $ and again we would like to find the smallest number generating the multiplicative group and such that the appropriate power is equal to the aforementioned k, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Can you give explicit (even inductive) formulae to achieve this? I guess even the problem of placing Knight 16 will give you a couple of hours to think about&#8230; (to be continued).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really like Matilde Marcolli&#8217;s <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/views-of-noncommutative-spaces.html">idea</a> to use some of Jackson Pollock&#8217;s paintings as metaphors for noncommutative spaces. In her talk she used this painting</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/PollockNCG.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>and refered to it (as did I in my post) as : Jackson Pollock “Untitled N.3”. Before someone writes a post &#8216;The Pollock noncommutative space hoax&#8217; (similar to <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-scottish-solids-hoax.html">my own</a> post) let me point out that I am well aware of the controversy surrounding this painting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/PollockContreversy.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" hspace=10>This painting is among 32 works recently discovered and initially attributed to Pollock.<br />
In fact, I&#8217;ve already told part of the story in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/doodles-worth-millions-or-not.html">Doodles worth millions (or not)?</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.gittte.be/">PD1</a>). The story involves the people on the right : from left to right, Jackson Pollock, his wife Lee Krasner, Mercedes Matter and her son Alex Matter.</p>
<p>Alex Matter, whose father, Herbert, and mother, Mercedes, were artists and friends of Jackson Pollock, discovered after his mother died a group of small drip paintings in a storage locker in Wainscott, N.Y. which he believed to be authentic Pollocks.</p>
<p>Read the post mentioned above if you want to know how mathematics screwed up his plan, or much better, reed the article <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2007/10/anatomy_of_the_jackson_pollock.html">Anatomy of the Jackson Pollock controversy</a> by Stephen Litt.</p>
<p>So, perhaps the painting above was not the smartest choice, but we could take any other genuine Pollock &#8216;drip-painting&#8217;, a technique he taught himself towards the end of 1946 to make an image by splashing, pouring, sloshing colors onto the canvas. Typically, such a painting consists of blops of paint, connected via thin drip-lines.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with noncommutative geometry? Well, consider the blops as &#8216;points&#8217;. In commutative geometry, distinct points cannot share tangent information ((technically : a commutative semi-local ring splits as the direct sum of local rings and this does no longer hold for a noncommutative semi-local ring)). In the noncommutative world though, they can!, or if you want to phrase it like this, noncommutative points &#8216;can talk to each other&#8217;. And, that&#8217;s what we cherish in those drip-lines.</p>
<p>But then, if two points share common tangent informations, they must be awfully close to each other&#8230; so one might imagine these Pollock-lines to be strings holding these points together. Hence, it would make more sense to consider the &#8216;Pollock-quotient-painting&#8217;, that is, the space one gets after dividing out the relation &#8216;connected by drip-lines&#8217; ((my guess is that Matilde thinks of the lines as the action of a group on the points giving a topological horrible quotient space, and thats precisely where noncommutative geometry shines)).</p>
<p>For this reason, my own mental picture of a genuinely noncommutative space  ((that is, the variety corresponding to a huge noncommutative algebra such as free algebras, group algebras of arithmetic groups or fundamental groups)) looks more like the picture below</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/LeBruynNCG.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>The colored blops you see are really sets of points which you might view as, say, a  FacebookGroup ((technically, think of them as the connected components of isomorphism classes of finite dimensional simple representations of your favorite noncommutative algebra)). Some chatter may occur between two distinct FacebookGroups, the more chatter the thicker the connection depicted ((technically, the size of the connection is the dimension of the ext-group between generic simples in the components)). Now, there are some tiny isolated spots (say blue ones in the upper right-hand quadrant). These should really be looked at as remote clusters of noncommutative points (sharing no (tangent) information whatsoever with the blops in the foregound). If we would zoom into them beyond the Planck scale (if I&#8217;m allowed to say a bollock-word in a Pollock-post) they might reveal again a whole universe similar to the interconnected blops upfront.</p>
<p>The picture was produced using the fabulous <a href="http://www.jacksonpollock.org/">Pollock engine</a>. Just use your mouse to draw and click to change colors in order to produce your very own noncommutative space!</p>
<p>For the mathematicians still around, this may sound like a lot of Pollock-bollocks but can be made precise. See my note <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2377">Noncommutative geometry and dual coalgebras</a> for a very terse reading. Now that coalgebras are <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/12/the_status_of_coalgebra.html">gaining popularity</a>, I really should write a more readable account of it, including some fanshi-wanshi examples&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Conway's nim-arithmetic on ordinal numbers leads to many surprising identities, for example who would have thought that the third power of the first infinite ordinal equals 2...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/Conway1P.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;"><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/on2-transfinite-number-hacking.html">Last time</a> we did recall Cantor&#8217;s addition and multiplication on ordinal numbers. Note that we can identify an ordinal number $\alpha $ with (the order type of) the set of all strictly smaller ordinals, that is, $\alpha = &#123; \alpha&#8217;~:~\alpha&#8217; &lt; \alpha &#125; $. Given two ordinals $\alpha $ and $\beta $ we will denote their Cantor-sums and products as $[ \alpha + \beta] $ and $[\alpha . \beta] $.</p>
<p>The reason for these square brackets is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a> constructed a well behaved nim-addition and nim-multiplication on all ordinals $\mathbf{On}_2 $ by imposing the &#8216;simplest&#8217; rules which make $\mathbf{On}_2 $ into a field. By this we mean that, in order to define the addition $\alpha + \beta $ we must have constructed before all sums $\alpha&#8217; + \beta $ and $\alpha + \beta&#8217; $ with $\alpha&#8217; &lt; \alpha $ and $\beta&#8217; &lt; \beta $. If + is going to be a well-defined addition on $\mathbf{On}_2 $ clearly $\alpha + \beta $ cannot be equal to one of these previously constructed sums and the &#8216;simplicity rule&#8217; asserts that we should take $\alpha+\beta $ the least ordinal different from all these sums $\alpha&#8217;+\beta $ and $\alpha+\beta&#8217; $. In symbols, we define</p>
<p>$\alpha+ \beta = \mathbf{mex} &#123; \alpha&#8217;+\beta,\alpha+ \beta&#8217;~|~\alpha&#8217; &lt; \alpha, \beta&#8217; &lt; \beta &#125; $</p>
<p>where $\mathbf{mex} $ stands for &#8216;minimal excluded value&#8217;. If you&#8217;d ever played the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">game of Nim</a> you will recognize this as the Nim-addition, at least when $\alpha $ and $\beta $ are finite ordinals (that is, natural numbers) (to nim-add two numbers n and m write them out in binary digits and add without carrying). Alternatively, the nim-sum n+m can be found applying the following two rules :</p>
<ul>
<li>the nim-sum of a number of distinct 2-powers is their ordinary sum (e.g. $8+4+1=13 $, and,  </li>
<li>the nim-sum of two equal numbers is 0.  </li>
</ul>
<p>So, all we have to do is to write numbers n and m as sums of two powers, scratch equal terms and add normally. For example, $13+7=(8+4+1)+(4+2+1)=8+2=10 $ (of course this is just digital sum without carry in disguise).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/nimaddition.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"> Here&#8217;s the beginning of the nim-addition table on ordinals. For example, to define $13+7 $ we have to look at all values in the first 7 entries of the row of 13 (that is, $&#123; 13,12,15,14,9,8,11 &#125; $) and the first 13 entries in the column of 7 (that is, $&#123; 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,15,14,13,12,11 &#125; $) and find the first number not included in these two sets (which is indeed $10 $).</p>
<p>In fact, the above two rules allow us to compute the nim-sum of any two ordinals. Recall from <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/on2-transfinite-number-hacking.html">last time</a> that every ordinal can be written uniquely as as a finite sum of (ordinal) 2-powers :<br />
$\alpha = [2^{\alpha_0} + 2^{\alpha_1} + \ldots + 2^{\alpha_k}] $, so to determine the nim-sum $\alpha+\beta $ we write both ordinals as sums of ordinal 2-powers, delete powers appearing twice and take the Cantor ordinal sum of the remaining sum.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/nimmultiplication.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;">Nim-multiplication of ordinals is a bit more complicated. Here&#8217;s the definition as a minimal excluded value</p>
<p>$\alpha.\beta = \mathbf{mex} &#123; \alpha&#8217;.\beta + \alpha.\beta&#8217; &#8211; \alpha&#8217;.\beta&#8217; &#125; $</p>
<p>for all $\alpha&#8217; &lt; \alpha, \beta&#8217; &lt; \beta $. The rationale behind this being that both $\alpha-\alpha&#8217; $ and $\beta &#8211; \beta&#8217; $ are non-zero elements, so if $\mathbf{On}_2 $ is going to be a field under nim-multiplication, their product should be non-zero (and hence strictly greater than 0), that is, $~(\alpha-\alpha&#8217;).(\beta-\beta&#8217;) > 0 $. Rewriting this we get $\alpha.\beta > \alpha&#8217;.\beta+\alpha.\beta&#8217;-\alpha&#8217;.\beta&#8217; $ and again the &#8216;simplicity rule&#8217; asserts that $\alpha.\beta $ should be the least ordinal satisfying all these inequalities, leading to the $\mathbf{mex} $-definition above. The table gives the beginning of the nim-multiplication table for ordinals. For finite ordinals n and m there is a simple 2 line procedure to compute their nim-product, similar to the addition-rules mentioned before :</p>
<ul>
<li>the nim-product of a number of distinct Fermat 2-powers (that is, numbers of the form $2^{2^n} $) is their ordinary product (for example, $16.4.2=128 $), and,  </li>
<li>the square of a Fermat 2-power is its sesquimultiple (that is, the number obtained by multiplying with $1\frac{1}{2} $ in the ordinary sense). That is, $2^2=3,4^2=6,16^2=24,&#8230; $  </li>
</ul>
<p>Using these rules, associativity and distributivity and our addition rules it is now easy to work out the nim-multiplication $n.m $ : write out n and m as sums of (multiplications by 2-powers) of Fermat 2-powers and apply the rules. Here&#8217;s an example</p>
<p>$5.9=(4+1).(4.2+1)=4^2.2+4.2+4+1=6.2+8+4+1=(4+2).2+13=4.2+2^2+13=8+3+13=6 $</p>
<p>Clearly, we&#8217;d love to have a similar procedure to calculate the nim-product $\alpha.\beta $ of arbitrary ordinals, or at least those smaller than $\omega^{\omega^{\omega}} $ (recall that Conway proved that this ordinal is isomorphic to the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2 $ of the field of two elements). From now on we restrict to such &#8216;small&#8217; ordinals and we introduce the following special elements :</p>
<p>$\kappa_{2^n} = [2^{2^{n-1}}] $ (these are the Fermat 2-powers) and for all primes $p > 2 $ we define<br />
$\kappa_{p^n} = [\omega^{\omega^{k-1}.p^{n-1}}] $ where $k $ is the number of primes strictly smaller than $p $ (that is, for p=3 we have k=1, for p=5, k=2 etc.).</p>
<p>Again by associativity and distributivity we will be able to multiply two ordinals $&lt; \omega^{\omega^{\omega}} $ if we know how to multiply a product</p>
<p>$[\omega^{\alpha}.2^{n_0}].[\omega^{\beta}.2^{m_0}] $ with $\alpha,\beta &lt; [\omega^{\omega}] $ and $n_0,m_0 \in \mathbb{N} $.</p>
<p>Now, $\alpha $ can be written uniquely as $[\omega^t.n_t+\omega^{t-1}.n_{t-1}+\ldots+\omega.n_2 + n_1] $ with t and all $n_i $ natural numbers. Write each $n_k $ in base $p $ where $p $ is the $k+1 $-th prime number, that is, we have for $n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_t $ an expression</p>
<p>$n_k=[\sum_j p^j.m(j,k)] $ with $0 \leq m(j,k) &lt; p $</p>
<p>The point of all this is that any of the special elements we want to multiply can be written as a unique expression as a decreasing product</p>
<p>$[\omega^{\alpha}.2^{n_0}] = [ \prod_q \kappa_q^m(q) ] $</p>
<p>where $q $ runs over all prime powers. The crucial fact now is that for this decreasing product we have a rule similar to addition of 2-powers, that is Conway-products coincide with the Cantor-products</p>
<p>$[ \prod_q \kappa_q^m(q) ] = \prod_q \kappa_q^m(q) $</p>
<p>But then, using associativity and commutativity of the Conway-product we can &#8216;nearly&#8217; describe all products $[\omega^{\alpha}.2^{n_0}].[\omega^{\beta}.2^{m_0}] $. The remaining problem being that it may happen that for some q we will end up with an exponent $m(q)+m(q&#8217;)>p $. But this can be solved if we know how to take p-powers. The rules for this are as follows</p>
<p>$~(\kappa_{2^n})^2 = \kappa_{2^n} + \prod_{1 \leq i &lt; n} \kappa_{2^i} $, for 2-powers, and,</p>
<p>$~(\kappa_{p^n})^p = \kappa_{p^{n-1}} $ for a prime $p > 2 $ and for $n \geq 2 $, and finally</p>
<p>$~(\kappa_p)^p = \alpha_p $ for a prime $p > 2 $, where $\alpha_p $ is the smallest ordinal $&lt; \kappa_p $ which cannot be written as a p-power $\beta^p $ with $\beta &lt; \kappa_p $. Summarizing : if we will be able to find these mysterious elements $\alpha_p $ for all prime numbers p, we are able to multiply in $[\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}]=\overline{\mathbb{F}}_2 $.</p>
<p>Let us determine the first one. We have that $\kappa_3 = \omega $ so we are looking for the smallest natural number $n &lt; \omega $ which cannot be written in num-multiplication as $n=m^3 $ for $m &lt; \omega $ (that is, also $m $ a natural number). Clearly $1=1^3 $ but what about 2? Can 2 be a third root of a natural number wrt. nim-multiplication? From the tabel above we see that 2 has order 3 whence its cube root must be an element of order 9. Now, the only finite ordinals that are subfields of $\mathbf{On}_2 $ are precisely the Fermat 2-powers, so if there is a finite cube root of 2, it must be contained in one of the finite fields $[2^{2^n}] $ (of which the mutiplicative group has order $2^{2^n}-1 $ and one easily shows that 9 cannot be a divisor of any of the numbers $2^{2^n}-1 $, that is, 2 doesn&#8217;t have a finte 3-th root in nim! Phrased differently, we found our first mystery number $\alpha_3 = 2 $. That is, we have the marvelous identity in nim-arithmetic</p>
<p>$\omega^3 = 2 $</p>
<p>Okay, so what is $\alpha_5 $? Well, we have $\kappa_5 = [\omega^{\omega}] $ and we have to look for the smallest ordinal which cannot be written as a 5-th root. By inspection of the finite nim-table we see that 1,2 and 3 have 5-th roots in $\omega $ but 4 does not! The reason being that 4 has order 15 (check in the finite field [16]) and 25 cannot divide any number of the form $2^{2^n}-1 $. That is, $\alpha_5=4 $ giving another crazy nim-identity</p>
<p>$~(\omega^{\omega})^5 = 4 $</p>
<p>And, surprises continue to pop up&#8230; Conway showed that $\alpha_7 = \omega+1 $ giving the nim-identity $~(\omega^{\omega^2})^7 = \omega+1 $. The proof of this already uses some clever finite field arguments. Because 7 doesn&#8217;t divide any number $2^{2^n}-1 $, none of the finite subfields $[2^{2^n}] $ contains a 7-th root of unity, so the 7-power map is injective whence surjective, so all finite ordinal have finite 7-th roots! That is, $\alpha_7 \geq \omega $. Because $\omega $ lies in a cubic extension of the finite field [4], the field generated by $\omega $ has  64 elements and so its multiplicative group is cyclic of order 63 and as $\omega $ has order 9, it must be a 7-th power in this field. But, as the only 7th powers in that field are precisely the powers of $\omega $ and by inspection $\omega+1 $ is not a 7-th power in that field (and hence also not in any field extension obtained by adjoining square, cube and fifth roots) so $\alpha_7=\omega +1 $.</p>
<p>Conway did stop at $\alpha_7 $ but I&#8217;ve always been intrigued by that one line in ONAG p.61 : &#8220;Hendrik Lenstra has computed $\alpha_p $ for $p \leq 43 $&#8221;. Next time we will see how Lenstra managed to do this and we will use sage to extend his list a bit further, including the first open case  :  $\alpha_{47}= \omega^{\omega^7}+1 $.</p>
<p>For an enjoyable video on all of this, see Conway&#8217;s MSRI lecture on <a href="http://www.msri.org/communications/ln/msri/2000/gametheory/conway/1/index.html">Infinite Games</a>. The nim-arithmetic part is towards the end of the lecture but watching the whole video is a genuine treat!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Some quotes of Andre Weil on the Riemann hypothesis.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by introductory remarks to the effect that &#8216;the field with one element was conceived by Jacques Tits half a century ago, etc. etc.&#8217;</p>
<p>While this is a historic fact, and, Jacques Tits cannot be given enough credit for bringing a touch of surrealism into mathematics, but this is not the main drive for people getting into F_un, today.</p>
<p>There is a much deeper and older motivation behind most papers published recently on  $\mathbb{F}_1 $. Few of the authors will be willing to let you in on the secret, though, because if they did, it would sound much too presumptuous&#8230;</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s have it out into the open : <strong>F_un mathematics&#8217; goal is no less than proving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann Hypothesis</a></strong>.</p>
<p>And even then, authors hide behind a smoke screen. The &#8216;official&#8217; explanation being &#8220;we would like to copy Weil&#8217;s proof of the Riemann hypothesis in the case of function fields of curves over finite fields, by considering spec(Z) as a &#8216;curve&#8217; over an algebra &#8216;dessous&#8217; Z namely $\mathbb{F}_1 $&#8221;. Alas, at this moment, none of the geometric approaches over the field with one element can make this stick.</p>
<p>Believe me for once, the main <a href="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/KroneckersJugendtraum.html">Jugendtraum</a> of most authors is to get a grip on cyclotomy over $\mathbb{F}_1 $. It is no accident that Connes makes a dramatic pauze in his <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/fun/index.php/connes-on-youtube.html">YouTubeVideo</a> to let the viewer see this equation on the backboard</p>
<p>$\mathbb{F}_{1^n} \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_1} \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^n-1) $</p>
<p>But, what is the basis of all this childlike enthusiasm? A somewhat concealed clue is given in the introduction of the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/fun/index.php/kapranovsmirnov.html">Kapranov-Smirnov paper</a>. They write :</p>
<p>&#8220;In [?] the affine line over $\mathbb{F}_1 $ was considered; it consists formally of 0 and all the roots of unity. Put slightly differently, this leads to the consideration of &#8220;algebraic extensions&#8221; of $\mathbb{F}_1 $. By analogy with genuine finite fields we would like to think that there is exactly one such extension of any given degree n, denote it by $\mathbb{F}_{1^n} $.</p>
<p>Of course, $\mathbb{F}_{1^n} $ does not exist in a rigorous sense, but we can think if a scheme $X $ contains n-th roots of unity, then it is defined over $\mathbb{F}_{1^n} $, so that there is a morphism</p>
<p>$p_X~:~X \rightarrow spec(\mathbb{F}_{1^n} $</p>
<p><strong>The point of view that adjoining roots of unity is analogous to the extension of the base field goes back, at least to Weil (Lettre a Artin, Ouvres, vol 1) and Iwasawa&#8230;</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p>Okay, so rush down to your library, pick out the first of three volumes of Andre Weil&#8217;s collected works, look up his letter to Emil Artin written on July 10th 1942 (19 printed pages!), and head for the final section. Weil writes :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/fun/DATA/andreweil1.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;"> &#8220;Our proof of the Riemann hypothesis (in the function field case, red.) depended upon the extension of the function-fields by roots of unity, i.e. by constants; the way in which the Galois group of such extensions operates on the classes of divisors in the original field and its extensions gives a linear operator, the characteristic roots (i.e. the eigenvalues) of which are the roots of the zeta-function.</p>
<p>On a number field, the nearest we can get to this is by adjunction of $l^n $-th roots of unity, $l $ being fixed; the Galois group of this infinite extension is cyclic, and defines a linear operator on the projective limit of the (absolute) class groups of those successive finite extensions; <strong>this should have something to do with the roots of the zeta-function of the field</strong>. However, our extensions are ramified (but only at a finite number of places, viz. the prime divisors of $l $). Thus a preliminary study of similar problems in function-fields might enable one to guess what will happen in number-fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few years later, in 1947, he makes this a bit more explicit in his marvelous essay &#8220;L&#8217;avenir des mathematiques&#8221; (The future of mathematics). Weil is still in shell-shock after the events of the second WW, and writes in beautiful archaic French sentences lasting forever :</p>
<p>&#8220;L&#8217;hypothèse de Riemann, après qu&#8217;on eu perdu l&#8217;espoir de la démontrer par les méthodes de la théorie des fonctions, nous apparaît aujourd&#8217;hui sous un jour nouveau, qui la montre inséparable de la conjecture d&#8217;Artin sur les fonctions L, ces deux problèmes étant deux aspects d&#8217;une même question arithmético-algébrique, <strong>où l&#8217;étude simultanée de toutes les extensions cyclotomiques d&#8217;un corps de nombres donné jouera sans doute le rôle décisif</strong>.</p>
<p>L&#8217;arithmétique gausienne gravitait autour de la loi de réciprocité quadratique; nous savons maintenant que celle-ci n&#8217;est qu&#8217;un premier example, ou pour mieux dire le paradigme, des lois dites &#8220;du corps de classe&#8221;, qui gouvernent les extensions abéliennes des corps de nobres algébriques; nous savons formuler ces lois de manière à leur donner l&#8217;aspect d&#8217;un ensemble cohérent; mais, si plaisante à l&#8217;œil que soit cette façade, nous ne savons si elle ne masque pas des symmétries plus cachées.</p>
<p>Les automorphismes induits sur les groupes de classes par les automorphismes du corps, les propriétés des restes de normes dans les cas non cycliques, le passage à la limite (inductive ou projective) <strong>quand on remplace le corps de base par des extensions, par example cyclotomiques, de degré indéfiniment croissant, sont autant de questions sur lesquelles notre ignorance est à peu près complète, et dont l&#8217;étude contient peut-être la clef de l&#8217;hypothese de Riemann</strong>; étroitement liée à celles-ci est l&#8217;étude du conducteur d&#8217;Artin, et en particulier, dans le cas local, la recherche de la représentation dont la trace s&#8217;exprime au moyen des caractères simples avec des coefficients égaux aux exposants de leurs conducteurs.</p>
<p>Ce sont là quelques-unes des directions qu&#8217;on peut et qu&#8217;on doit songer à suivre afin de pénétrer dans le mystère des extensions non abéliennes; il n&#8217;est pas impossible que nous touchions là à des principes d&#8217;une fécondité extraordinaire, et que le premier pas décisif une fois fait dans cette voie doive nous ouvrir l&#8217;accès à de vastes domaines dont nous soupçonnons à peine l&#8217;existence; car jusqu&#8217;ici, pour amples que soient nos généralisations des résultats de Gauss, on ne peut dire que nus les ayons vraiment dépassés.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Arnold has written a follow-up to the paper mentioned last time called “Polymathematics : is mathematics a single science or a set of arts?” (or&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arnold has written a follow-up to the paper mentioned <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/arnolds-trinities.html">last time</a> called <a href="http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~arnsem/Arnold/Polymath.ps.gz">“Polymathematics : is mathematics a single science or a set of arts?”</a> (or <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/ArnoldPolymathics.pdf">here</a> for a (huge) PDF-conversion).</p>
<p>On page 8 of that paper is a nice summary of his 25 trinities :</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/arnoldv2.jpg"  ><br />
</center></p>
<p>I learned of this newer paper from a comment by <a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~chapoton/">Frederic Chapoton</a> who maintains a <a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~chapoton/trinites.html">nice webpage</a> dedicated to trinities.</p>
<p>In his list there is one trinity on sporadic groups :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/trinity1.jpg" align=center ></p>
<p>where $F_{24} $ is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_group">Fischer simple group</a> of order $2^{21}.3^{16}.5^2.7^3.11.13.17.23.29 = 1255205709190661721292800 $, which is the third largest sporadic group (the two larger ones being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Monster_group">Baby Monster</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group">Monster</a> itself).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the rationale is behind this trinity. But I&#8217;d like to recall the (Baby)Monster history as a warning against the trinity-reflex. Sometimes, there is just no way to extend a <strong>would be</strong> trinity.</p>
<p>The story comes from Mark Ronan&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.maa.org/reviews/SymmetryMonster.html">Symmetry and the Monster</a> on page 178.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s remind ourselves how we got here. A few years earlier, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Fischer">Fischer</a> has created his &#8216;transposition&#8217; groups Fi22, Fi23, and Fi24. He had called them M(22), M(23), and M(24), because they were related to Mathieu&#8217;s groups M22,M23, and M24, and since he used Fi22 to create his new group of mirror symmetries, he tentatively called it $M^{22} $.<br />
It seemed to appear as a cross-section in something even bigger, and as this larger group was clearly associated with Fi24, he labeled it $M^{24} $. Was there something in between that could be called $M^{23} $? <br />
Fischer visited Cambridge to talk on his new work, and Conway named these three potential groups the <strong>Baby Monster</strong>, the <strong>Middle Monster</strong>, and the<strong> Super Monster</strong>. When it became clear that the Middle Monster didn&#8217;t exist, Conway settled on the names Baby Monster and Monster, and this became the standard terminology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Marcus du Sautoy&#8217;s account in <a href="http://findingmoonshine.blogspot.com/">Finding Moonshine</a> is slightly different. He tells on page 322 that the Super Monster didn&#8217;t exist. Anyone knowing the factual story?</p>
<blockquote><p>Some mathematical trickery later revealed that the Super Monster was going to be impossible to build: there were certain features that contradicted each other. It was just a mirage, which vanished under closer scrutiny. But the other two were still looking robust. The Middle Monster was rechristened simply the Monster.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, the inclusion diagram of the sporadic simples tells yet another story.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/sporadics.jpg" ><br />
</center></p>
<p>Anyhow, this inclusion diagram is helpful in seeing the three generations of the <strong>Happy Family</strong> (as well as the <strong>Pariahs</strong>) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_group">sporadic groups</a>, terminology invented by <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~rlg/">Robert Griess</a> in his 100+p Inventiones paper on the construction of the Monster (which he liked to call, for obvious reasons, the Friendly Giant denoted by FG).<br />
The happy family appears in Table 1.1. of the introduction.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/Griess.jpg" ><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/happyfamily.jpg" width=400 ><br />
</center></p>
<p>It was this picture that made me propose the trinity on the left below in the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/arnolds-trinities.html">previous post</a>. I now like to add another trinity on the right, and, the connection between the two is clear.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/trinity2.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>Here $Golay $ denotes the extended binary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code">Golay code</a> of which the Mathieu group $M_{24} $ is the automorphism group. $Leech $ is of course the 24-dimensional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice">Leech lattice</a> of which the automorphism group is a double cover of the Conway group $Co_1 $. $Griess $ is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griess_algebra">Griess algebra</a> which is a nonassociative 196884-dimensional algebra of which the automorphism group is the Monster.</p>
<p>I am aware of a construction of the Leech lattice involving the quaternions (the icosian construction of chapter 8, section 2.2 of <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/SPLAG">SPLAG</a>). Does anyone know of a construction of the Griess algebra involving octonions???</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are only a handful of human activities where one goes to extraordinary lengths to keep a dream alive, in spite of overwhelming evidence : religion, theoretical physics, supporting the Belgian football team and &#8230;  mathematics.</p>
<p>In recent years several people spend a lot of energy looking for properties of an elusive object : <strong>the field with one element</strong> $\mathbb{F}_1 $, or in French : &#8220;F-un&#8221;. The topic must have reached a level of maturity as there was a conference dedicated entirely to it : <a href="http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~ncgoa/workshop2008.html">NONCOMMUTATIVE GEOMETRY AND GEOMETRY OVER THE FIELD WITH ONE ELEMENT</a>.</p>
<p>In this series I&#8217;d like to find out what the fuss is all about, why people would like it to exist and what it has to do with noncommutative geometry. However, before we start two remarks :</p>
<p>The field $\mathbb{F}_1 $ <strong>does not exist</strong>, so don&#8217;t try to make sense of sentences such as &#8220;The ‘field with one element’ is the free algebraic monad generated by one constant (p.26), or the universal generalized ring with zero (p.33)&#8221; in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_with_one_element">wikipedia-entry</a>. The simplest proof is that in any (unitary) ring we have $0 \not= 1 $ so any ring must contain at least two elements. A more highbrow version : the ring of integers $\mathbb{Z} $ is the initial object in the category of unitary rings, so it cannot be an algebra over anything else.</p>
<p>The second remark is that several people have already written blog-posts about $\mathbb{F}_1 $. Here are a few I know of : David Corfield at the <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/04/the_field_with_one_element.html">n-category cafe</a> and at his <a href="http://www.dcorfield.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/2005/11/november-1-12.html">old blog</a>, Noah Snyder at the <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/the-field-with-one-element/">secret blogging seminar</a>, Kea at the <a href="http://kea-monad.blogspot.com/2008/06/m-theory-lesson-193.html">Arcadian functor</a>, AC and K. Consani at <a href="http://noncommutativegeometry.blogspot.com/2008/05/ncg-and-fun.html">Noncommutative geometry</a> and John Baez wrote about it in his <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week259.html">weekly finds</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/Riemann.jpg" hspace=10 style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" > The dream we like to keep alive is that we will prove the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a> one fine day by lifting Weil&#8217;s proof of it in the case of curves over finite fields to rings of integers.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t know a word about Weil&#8217;s method, if you think about it for a couple of minutes, there are two immediate formidable problems with this strategy.</p>
<p>For most people this would be evidence enough to discard the approach, but, we mathematicians have found extremely clever ways for going into denial.</p>
<p>The first problem is that if we want to think of $\mathbf{spec}(\mathbb{Z}) $ (or rather its completion adding the infinite place) as a curve over some field, then $\mathbb{Z} $ must be an algebra over this field. However, no such field can exist&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/soule.jpg" hspace=10 style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" > No problem! If there is no such field, let us invent one, and call it $\mathbb{F}_1 $. But, it is a bit hard to do geometry over an illusory field. <a href="http://www.ihes.fr/~soule/">Christophe Soule</a> succeeded in defining varieties over $\mathbb{F}_1 $ in a <a href="http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/digitalAssets/456_MPI-1999-50-m.ps">talk at the 1999 Arbeitstagung</a> and in a more recent write-up of it : <a href="http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/soule.pdf">Les varietes sur le corps a un element</a>.</p>
<p>We will come back to this in more detail later, but for now, here&#8217;s the main idea. Consider an existent field $k $ and an algebra $k \rightarrow R $ over it. Now study the properties of the functor (extension of scalars) from $k $-schemes to $R $-schemes. Even if there is no morphism $\mathbb{F}_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} $, let us assume it exists and define $\mathbb{F}_1 $-varieties by requiring that these guys should satisfy the properties found before for extension of scalars on schemes defined over a field by going to schemes over an algebra (in this case, $\mathbb{Z} $-schemes). Roughly speaking this defines $\mathbb{F}_1 $-schemes as subsets of points of suitable $\mathbb{Z} $-schemes.</p>
<p>But, this is just one half of the story. He adds to such an $\mathbb{F}_1 $-variety extra topological data &#8216;at infinity&#8217;, an idea he attributes to J.-B. Bost. This added feature is a $\mathbb{C} $-algebra $\mathcal{A}_X $, which does not necessarily have to be commutative. He only writes : &#8220;Par ignorance, nous resterons tres evasifs sur les proprietes requises sur cette $\mathbb{C} $-algebre.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/connes.jpg" width=200 hspace=10 style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" > The algebra $\mathcal{A}_X $ originates from trying to bypass the second major obstacle with the Weil-Riemann-strategy. On a smooth projective curve all points look similar as is clear for example by noting that the completions of all local rings are isomorphic to the formal power series $k[[x]] $ over the basefield, in particular there is no distinction between &#8216;finite&#8217; points and those lying at &#8216;infinity&#8217;.</p>
<p>The completions of the local rings of points in $\mathbf{spec}(\mathbb{Z}) $ on the other hand are completely different, for example, they have residue fields of different characteristics&#8230; Still, local class field theory asserts that their quotient fields have several common features. For example, their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer_group">Brauer groups</a> are all isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} $. However, as $Br(\mathbb{R}) = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} $ and $Br(\mathbb{C}) = 0 $, even then there would be a clear distinction between the finite primes and the place at infinity&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alainconnes.org/en/">Alain Connes</a> came up with an extremely elegant solution to bypass this problem in <a href="http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/imufinal.pdf">Noncommutative geometry and the Riemann zeta function</a>. He proposes to replace finite dimensional central simple algebras in the definition of the Brauer group by AF (for Approximately Finite dimensional)-central simple algebras over $\mathbb{C} $. This is the origin and the importance of the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-bost-connes-hecke-algebra.html">Bost-Connes algebra</a>.</p>
<p>We will come back to most of this in more detail later, but for the impatient, Connes has written a paper together with Caterina Consani and Matilde Marcolli <a href="http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/funBC.pdf">Fun with $\mathbb{F}_1 $</a> relating the Bost-Connes algebra to the field with one element.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Conway once wrote :</p>
<blockquote><p>There are almost as many different constructions of $M_{24} $ as there have been mathematicians interested in that most remarkable of all finite groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-inguanodon-dissected.html">the inguanodon post</a> Ive added yet another construction of the Mathieu groups $M_{12} $ and $M_{24} $ starting from (half of) the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">Farey sequences</a> and the associated cuboid tree diagram obtained by demanding that all edges are odd. In this way the Mathieu groups turned out to be part of a (conjecturally) infinite sequence of simple groups, starting <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/more-iguanodons-via-kfareysage.html">as follows</a> :</p>
<p>$L_2(7),M_{12},A_{16},M_{24},A_{28},A_{40},A_{48},A_{60},A_{68},A_{88},A_{96},A_{120},A_{132},A_{148},A_{164},A_{196},\ldots $</p>
<p>It is quite easy to show that none of the other sporadics will appear in this sequence via their known permutation representations. Still, several of the sporadic simple groups are generated by an element of order two and one of order three, so they are determined by a finite dimensional permutation representation of the modular group $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $ and hence are hiding in a special polygonal region of the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-dedekind-tessellation.html">Dedekind&#8217;s tessellation</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/dedekind1877.gif" align=center ></p>
<p>Let us try to figure out where the sporadic with the next simplest permutation representation is hiding : the <a href="http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/spor/J2/">second Janko group</a> $J_2 $, via its <a href="http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/permrep/J2G1-p100B0">100-dimensional permutation representation</a>. The Atlas tells us that the order two and three generators act as</p>
<pre>
e:= (1,84)(2,20)(3,48)(4,56)(5,82)(6,67)(7,55)(8,41)(9,35)(10,40)(11,78)(12, 100)(13,49)(14,37)(15,94)(16,76)(17,19)(18,44)(21,34)(22,85)(23,92)(24, 57)(25,75)(26,28)(27,64)(29,90)(30,97)(31,38)(32,68)(33,69)(36,53)(39,61) (42,73)(43,91)(45,86)(46,81)(47,89)(50,93)(51,96)(52,72)(54,74)(58,99) (59,95)(60,63)(62,83)(65,70)(66,88)(71,87)(77,98)(79,80);

v:= (1,80,22)(2,9,11)(3,53,87)(4,23,78)(5,51,18)(6,37,24)(8,27,60)(10,62,47) (12,65,31)(13,64,19)(14,61,52)(15,98,25)(16,73,32)(17,39,33)(20,97,58) (21,96,67)(26,93,99)(28,57,35)(29,71,55)(30,69,45)(34,86,82)(38,59,94) (40,43,91)(42,68,44)(46,85,89)(48,76,90)(49,92,77)(50,66,88)(54,95,56) (63,74,72)(70,81,75)(79,100,83);

<p>But as the <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~kurthc/research/kfarey011408.zip">kfarey.sage package</a> written by <a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~kurthc/index.html">Chris Kurth</a> calculates the Farey symbol using the L-R generators, we use GAP to find those</p>

<p>Defining these permutations in sage and using kfarey, this gives us the Farey-symbol of the associated permutation representation</p>

<p>Here, the first string gives the numerators of the cusps, the second the denominators and the third gives the pairing information (where [tex[-2 $ denotes an even edge and $-3 $ an odd edge. Fortunately, kfarey also allows us to draw the special polygonal region determined by a Farey-symbol. So, here it is (without the pairing data) :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/janko2.jpg" align=center ></p>
<p>the hiding place of $J_2 $&#8230;</p>
<p>It would be nice to have (a) other Farey-symbols associated to the second Janko group, hopefully showing a pattern that one can extend into an infinite family as in the inguanodon series and (b) to determine Farey-symbols of more sporadic groups.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Towards the end of the Bost-Connes for ringtheorists post I freaked-out because I realized that the commutation morphisms with the $X_n^* $ were given by&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Towards the end of the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/bost-connes-for-ringtheorists.html">Bost-Connes for ringtheorists</a> post I freaked-out because I realized that the commutation morphisms with the $X_n^* $ were given by non-unital algebra maps. I failed to notice the obvious, that algebras such as $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] $ have plenty of <strong>idempotents</strong> and that this mysterious &#8216;non-unital&#8217; morphism was nothing else but multiplication with an idempotent&#8230;</p>
<p>Here a sketch of a ringtheoretic framework in which the Bost-Connes Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H} $ is a motivating example (the details should be worked out by an eager 20-something). Start with a <strong>suitable</strong> semi-group $S $, by which I mean that one must be able to invert the elements of $S $ and obtain a group $G $ of which all elements have a canonical form $g=s_1s_2^{-1} $. Probably semi-groupies have a name for these things, so if you know please drop a comment.</p>
<p>The next ingredient is a <strong>suitable</strong> ring $R $. Here, suitable means that we have a semi-group morphism<br />
$\phi~:~S \rightarrow End(R) $ where $End(R) $ is the semi-group of all ring-endomorphisms of $R $ satisfying the following two (usually strong) conditions :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every $\phi(s) $ has a right-inverse, meaning that there is an ring-endomorphism $\psi(s) $ such that $\phi(s) \circ \psi(s) = id_R $ (this implies that all $\phi(s) $ are in fact <strong>epi-morphisms</strong> (surjective)), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The composition $\psi(s) \circ \phi(s) $ usually is NOT the identity morphism $id_R $ (because it is zero on the kernel of the epimorphism $\phi(s) $) but we require that there is an idempotent $E_s \in R $ (that is, $E_s^2 = E_s $) such that $\psi(s) \circ \phi(s) = id_R E_s $</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of the first condition is that the $S $-semi-group graded ring $A = \oplus_{s \in S} X_s R $ is <strong>crystalline</strong> graded (crystalline group graded rings were introduced by Fred Van Oystaeyen and Erna Nauwelaarts) meaning that for every $s \in S $ we have in the ring $A $ the equality $X_s R = R X_s $ where this is a free right $R $-module of rank one. One verifies that this is equivalent to the existence of an epimorphism $\phi(s) $ such that for all $r \in R $ we have $r X_s = X_s \phi(s)(r) $.</p>
<p>The point of the second condition is that this semi-graded ring $A$ can be naturally embedded in a $G $-graded ring $B = \oplus_{g=s_1s_2^{-1} \in G} X_{s_1} R X_{s_2}^* $ which is <strong>bi-crystalline</strong> graded meaning that for all $r \in R $ we have that $r X_s^*= X_s^* \psi(s)(r) E_s $.</p>
<p>It is clear from the construction that under the given conditions (and probably some minor extra ones making everything stand) the group graded ring $B $ is determined fully by the semi-group graded ring $A $.</p>
<p><strong>what does this general ringtheoretic mumbo-jumbo have to do with the BC- (or Bost-Connes) algebra $\mathcal{H} $?</strong></p>
<p>In this particular case, the semi-group $S $ is the multiplicative semi-group of positive integers $\mathbb{N}^+_{\times} $ and the corresponding group $G $ is the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}^+_{\times} $ of all positive rational numbers.</p>
<p>The ring $R $ is the rational group-ring $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] $ of the torsion-group $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} $. Recall that the elements of $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z} $ are the rational numbers $0 \leq \lambda &lt; 1 $ and the group-law is ordinary addition and forgetting the integral part (so merely focussing on the &#8216;after the comma&#8217; part). The group-ring is then</p>
<p>$\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] = \oplus_{0 \leq \lambda &lt; 1} \mathbb{Q} Y_{\lambda} $ with multiplication linearly induced by the multiplication on the base-elements $Y_{\lambda}.Y_{\mu} = Y_{\lambda+\mu} $.</p>
<p>The epimorphism determined by the semi-group map $\phi~:~\mathbb{N}^+_{\times} \rightarrow End(\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}]) $ are given by the algebra maps defined by linearly extending the map on the base elements $\phi(n)(Y_{\lambda}) = Y_{n \lambda} $ (observe that this is indeed an epimorphism as every base element $Y_{\lambda} = \phi(n)(Y_{\frac{\lambda}{n}}) $.</p>
<p>The right-inverses $\psi(n) $ are the ring morphisms defined by linearly extending the map on the base elements $\psi(n)(Y_{\lambda}) = \frac{1}{n}(Y_{\frac{\lambda}{n}} + Y_{\frac{\lambda+1}{n}} + \ldots + Y_{\frac{\lambda+n-1}{n}}) $ (check that these are indeed ring maps, that is that $\psi(n)(Y_{\lambda}).\psi(n)(Y_{\mu}) = \psi(n)(Y_{\lambda+\mu}) $.</p>
<p>These are indeed right-inverses satisfying the idempotent condition for clearly $\phi(n) \circ \psi(n) (Y_{\lambda}) = \frac{1}{n}(Y_{\lambda}+\ldots+Y_{\lambda})=Y_{\lambda} $ and</p>
<p>$\begin{eqnarray} \psi(n) \circ \phi(n) (Y_{\lambda}) =&amp; \psi(n)(Y_{n \lambda}) = \frac{1}{n}(Y_{\lambda} + Y_{\lambda+\frac{1}{n}} + \ldots + Y_{\lambda+\frac{n-1}{n}}) \\ =&amp; Y_{\lambda}.(\frac{1}{n}(Y_0 + Y_{\frac{1}{n}} + \ldots + Y_{\frac{n-1}{n}})) = Y_{\lambda} E_n \end{eqnarray} $</p>
<p>and one verifies that $E_n = \frac{1}{n}(Y_0 + Y_{\frac{1}{n}} + \ldots + Y_{\frac{n-1}{n}}) $ is indeed an idempotent in $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] $. In the previous posts in this series we have already seen that with these definitions we have indeed that the BC-algebra is the bi-crystalline graded ring</p>
<p>$B = \mathcal{H} = \oplus_{\frac{m}{n} \in \mathbb{Q}^+_{\times}} X_m \mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] X_n^* $</p>
<p>and hence is naturally constructed from the skew semi-group graded algebra $A = \oplus_{m \in \mathbb{N}^+_{\times}} X_m \mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] $.</p>
<p>This (probably) explains why the BC-algebra $\mathcal{H} $ is itself usually called and denoted in $C^* $-algebra papers the skew semigroup-algebra $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] \bowtie \mathbb{N}^+_{\times} $ as this subalgebra (our crystalline semi-group graded algebra $A $) determines the Hecke algebra completely.</p>
<p>Finally, the bi-crystalline idempotents-condition works well in the settings of von Neumann regular algebras (such as all limits of finite dimensional semi-simples, for example $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}] $) because such algebras excel at <strong>idempotents galore</strong>&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A classic <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Weil.html">Andre Weil</a>-tale is his narrow escape from being shot as a Russian spy</p>
<blockquote><p>The war was a disaster for Weil who was a conscientious objector and so wished to avoid military service. He fled to Finland, to visit Rolf Nevanlinna, as soon as war was declared. This was an attempt to avoid being forced into the army, but it was not a simple matter to escape from the war in Europe at this time. Weil was arrested in Finland and when letters in Russian were found in his room (they were actually from Pontryagin describing mathematical research) things looked pretty black. One day Nevanlinna was told that they were about to execute Weil as a spy, and he was able to persuade the authorities to deport Weil instead.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/weil.gif" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" > However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Weil">Weil&#8217;s wikipedia entry</a> calls this a story too good to be true, and continues</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1992, the Finnish mathematician Osmo Pekonen went to the archives to check the facts. Based on the documents, he established that Weil was not really going to be shot, even if he was under arrest, and that Nevanlinna probably didn&#8217;t do &#8211; and didn&#8217;t need to do &#8211; anything to save him. Pekonen published a paper on this with an afterword by Andre Weil himself. Nevanlinna&#8217;s motivation for concocting such a story of himself as the rescuer of a famous Jewish mathematician probably was the fact that he had been a Nazi sympathizer during the war. The story also appears in Nevanlinna&#8217;s autobiography, published in Finnish, but the dates don&#8217;t match with real events at all. It is true, however, that Nevanlinna housed Weil in the summer of 1939 at his summer residence Korkee at Lohja in Finland &#8211; and offered Hitler&#8217;s Mein Kampf as bedside reading.</p></blockquote>
<p>This old spy-story gets a recent twist now that it turns out that Weil&#8217;s descent theory of tori has applications to cryptography. So far, I haven&#8217;t really defined what tori are, so let us start with some basics.</p>
<p>The simplest (and archetypical) example of an <strong>algebraic torus</strong> is the <strong>multiplicative group</strong>(scheme) $\mathbb{G}_m $ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q $ which is the affine variety</p>
<p>$\mathbb{V}(xy-1) \subset \mathbb{A}^2_{\mathbb{F}_q} $. that is, the $\mathbb{F}_q $ points of $\mathbb{G}_m $ are precisely the couples $&#123; (x,\frac{1}{x})~:~x \in \mathbb{F}_q^* &#125; $ and so are in one-to-one correspondence with the non-zero elements of $\mathbb{F}_q $. The coordinate ring of this variety is the ring of Laurant polynomials $\mathbb{F}_q[x,x^{-1}] $ and the fact that multiplication induces a group-structure on the points of the variety can be rephrased by saying that this coordinate ring is a <strong>Hopf algebra</strong> which is just the Hopf structure on the <strong>group-algebra</strong> $\mathbb{F}_q[\mathbb{Z}] = \mathbb{F}_q[x,x^{-1}] $. This is the first indication of a connection between <strong>tori</strong> defined over $\mathbb{F}_q $ and <strong>lattices</strong> (that is free $\mathbb{Z} $-modules with an action of the Galois group $Gal(\overline{F}_q/F_q) $. In this correspondence, the multiplicative group scheme $\mathbb{G}_m $ corresponds to $\mathbb{Z} $ with the trivial action.</p>
<p>Now take a field extension $\mathbb{F}_q \subset \mathbb{F}_{q^n} $, is there an affine variety, defined over $\mathbb{F}_q $ whose $\mathbb{F}_q $-points are precisely the invertible elements $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^* $? Sure! Just take the multiplicative group over $\mathbb{F}_{q^n} $ and write the elements x and y as $x = x_1 + x_2 a_2 + \ldots + x_n a_n $ (and a similar expression for y with $&#123; 1,a_2,\ldots,a_n &#125;$ being a basis of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_q $ and write the defning equation $xy-1 $ out, also with respect to this basis and this will then give you the equations of the desired variety, which is usually denoted by $R^1_{\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{G}_m $ and called the <strong>Weil restriction of scalars torus</strong>.</p>
<p>A concrete example? Take $\mathbb{F}_9 = \mathbb{F}_3(\sqrt{-1}) $ and write $x=x_1+x_2 \sqrt{-1} $ and $y=y_1+y_2 \sqrt{-1} $, then the defining equation $xy-1 $ becomes</p>
<p>$~(x_1y_1-x_2y_2) + (x_1y_2-x_2y_1) \sqrt{-1} = 1 $</p>
<p>whence $R^1_{\mathbb{F}_9/\mathbb{F}_3} = \mathbb{V}(x_1y_1-x_2y_2-1,x_1y_2-x_2y_1) \subset \mathbb{A}^4_{\mathbb{F}_3} $, the intersection of two quadratic hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional space.</p>
<p>Why do we call $R^1 \mathbb{G}_m $ a _torus_? Well, as with any variety defined over $\mathbb{F}_q $ we can also look at its points over a field-extension, for example over the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q $ and then it is easy to see that</p>
<p>$R^1_{\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{G}_m (\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q) = \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^* \times \ldots \times \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^* $ (n copies)</p>
<p>and such algebraic groups are called <strong>tori</strong>. (To understand terminology, the compact group corresponding to $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^* $ is $U_1 \times U_1 = S^1 \times S^1 $, so a torus).</p>
<p>In fact, it is already the case that the $\mathbb{F}_{q^n} $ points of the restriction of scalar torus are $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}^* \times \ldots \times \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^* $ and therefore we call this field a <strong>splitting field</strong> of the torus.</p>
<p>This is the general definition of an algebraic torus : a <strong>torus T over $\mathbb{F}_q $</strong> is an affine group scheme over $\mathbb{F}_q $ such that, if we extend scalars to the algebraic closure (and then it already holds for a finite extension) we get an isomorphism of affine group schemes</p>
<p>$T \times_{\mathbb{F}_q} \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q = \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^* \times \ldots \times \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^* = (\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^*)^{n} $</p>
<p>in which case we call T a torus of dimension n. Clearly, the Galois group $Gal(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^*/\mathbb{F}_q) $ acts on the left hand side in such a way that we recover $T $ as the orbit space for this action.</p>
<p>Hence, anther way to phrase this is to say that an algebraic torus is the <strong>Weil descent</strong> of an action of the Galois group on the algebraic group $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^* \times \ldots \times \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^* $.</p>
<p>Of course we can also rephrase this is more algebraic terms by looking at the coordinate rings. The coordinate ring of the algebraic group $~(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q^*)^n $ is the group-algebra of the rank n lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n = \mathbb{Z} \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathbb{Z} $ (the free Abelian group of rank n), that is,<br />
$\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q [ \mathbb{Z}^n ] $. Now the Galois group acts both on the field $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q $ as on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n $ coming from the action of the Galois group on the extended torus $T \times_{\mathbb{F}_q} \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q $. In fact, it is best to denote this specific action on $\mathbb{Z}^n $ by $T^* $ and call $T^* $ the character group of $T $. Now, we recover the coordinate ring of the $\mathbb{F}_q $-torus $T $ as the ring of invariants</p>
<p>$\mathbb{F}_q[T] = \overline{\mathbb{F}}_q [T^*]^{Gal(\overline{\mathbb{F}}_q/\mathbb{F}_q)} $</p>
<p>Hence, the restriction of scalars torus $R^1_{\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{G}_m $ is an n-dimensional torus over $\mathbb{F}_q $ and its corresponding character group is the free Abelian group of rank n which can be written as $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^n-1) = \mathbb{Z}1 \oplus \mathbb{Z}x \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathbb{Z}x^{n-1} $ and where the action of the cyclic Galois group $Gal(\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_q) = C_n = \langle \sigma \rangle $ s such that the generator $\sigma $ as as multiplication by $x $. That is, in this case the character group is a <strong>permutation lattice</strong> meaning that the $\mathbb{Z} $-module has a basis which is permuted under the action of the Galois group. Next time we will encounter more difficult tori sich as the <strong>crypto-torus</strong> $T_n $.</p>
