										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-birthplace-of-schemes">Last time</a>, we&#8217;ve seen that the first time &#8216;schemes&#8217; were introduced was in &#8216;La Tribu&#8217; (the internal Bourbaki-account of their congresses) of the May-June 1955 congress in Chicago.</p>
<p>Here, we will focus on the events leading up to that event. If you always thought Grothendieck invented the word &#8216;schemes&#8217;, here&#8217;s what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McLarty">Colin McLarty</a> wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;A story says that in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/grothendiecks-cafe">a Paris café</a> around 1955 Grothendieck asked his friends &#8220;what is a scheme?&#8221;. <strong>At the time only an undefined idea of &#8220;schéma&#8221; was current in Paris, meaning more or less whatever would improve on Weil&#8217;s foundations.</strong>&#8221; (McLarty in <a href="https://www.landsburg.com/grothendieck/mclarty1.pdf">The Rising Sea</a>)</p>
<p>What were Weil&#8217;s foundations of algebraic geometry?</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s see how Weil defined an affine variety over a field $k$. First you consider a &#8216;universal field&#8217; $K$ containing $k$, that is, $K$ is an algebraically closed field of infinite transcendence degree over $k$. A point of $n$-dimensional affine space is an $n$-tuple $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n) \in K^n$. For such a point $x$ you consider the field $k(x)$ which is the subfield of $K$ generated by $k$ and the coordinates $x_i$ of $x$.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the field $k(x)$ is the field of fractions of the affine domain $R=k[z_1,\dots,z_n]/I$ where $I$ is the prime ideal of all polynomials $f \in k[z_1,\dots,z_n]$ such that $f(x) = f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=0$.</p>
<p>An affine $k$-variety $V$ is associated to a &#8216;generic point&#8217; $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$, meaning that the field $k(x)$ is a &#8216;regular extension&#8217; of $k$ (that is, for all field-extensions $k&#8217;$ of $k$, the tensor product $k(x) \otimes_k k&#8217;$ does not contain zero-divisors.</p>
<p>The points of $V$ are the &#8216;specialisations&#8217; of $x$, that is, all points $y=(y_1,\dots,y_n)$ such that $f(y_1,\dots,y_n)=0$ for all $f \in I$.</p>
<p>Perhaps an example? Let $k = \mathbb{Q}$ and $K=\mathbb{C}$ and take $x=(i,\pi)$ in the affine plane $\mathbb{C}^2$. What is the corresponding prime ideal $I$ of $\mathbb{Q}[z_1,z_2]$? Well, $i$ is a solution to $z_1^2+1=0$ whereas $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$, so $I=(z_1^2+1)$ and $R=\mathbb{Q}[z_1,z_2]/I= \mathbb{Q}(i)[z_2]$.</p>
<p>Is $x=(i,\pi)$ a generic point? Well, suppose it were, then the points of the corresponding affine variety $V$ would be all couples $(\pm i, \lambda)$ with $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ which is the union of two lines in $\mathbb{C}^2$. But then $i \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes i$ is a zero-divisor in $\mathbb{Q}(x) \otimes_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathbb{Q}(i)$. So no, it is not a generic point over $\mathbb{Q}$ and does not define an affine $\mathbb{Q}$-variety.</p>
<p>If we would have started with $k=\mathbb{Q}(i)$, then $x=(i,\pi)$ is generic and the corresponding affine variety $V$ consists of all points $(i,\lambda) \in \mathbb{C}^2$.</p>
<p>If this is new to you, consider yourself lucky to be young enough to have learned AG from <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf">Fulton&#8217;s Algebraic curves</a>, or <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/aconstant/Alg2/Bib/Hartshorne.pdf">Hartshorne&#8217;s chapter 1</a> if you were that ambitious.</p>
<p>By 1955, Serre had written his <a href="https://www.college-de-france.fr/media/jean-pierre-serre/UPL5435398796951750634_Serre_FAC.pdf">FAC</a>, and Bourbaki had developed enough commutative algebra to turn His attention to algebraic geometry.</p>
<p><strong>La Ciotat congress (February 27th &#8211; March 6th, 1955)</strong></p>
<p>With a splendid view on the mediterranean, a small group of Bourbaki members (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a> (then 51), with two of his former Ph.D. students: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Koszul">Jean-Louis Koszul</a> (then 34), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> (then 29, and fresh Fields medaillist), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a> (then 31), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Samuel">Pierre Samuel</a> (then 34), a former student of Zariski&#8217;s) discussed a previous &#8216;Rapport de Geometrie Algebrique'(no. 206) and arrived at some unanimous decisions:</p>
<p>1. Algebraic varieties must be sets of points, which will not change at every moment.<br />
2. One should include &#8216;abstract&#8217; varieties, obtained by gluing (fibres, etc.).<br />
3. All necessary algebra must have been previously proved.<br />
4. The main application of purely algebraic methods being characteristic p, we will hide nothing of the unpleasant phenomena that occur there.</p>
<p><center><br />

(Henri Cartan and Jean-Pierre Serre, photo by Paul Halmos)<br />
</center></p>
<p>The approach the propose is clearly based on Serre&#8217;s FAC. The points of an affine variety are the maximal ideals of an affine $k$-algebra, this set is equipped with the Zariski topology such that the local rings form a structure sheaf. Abstract varieties are then constructed by gluing these topological spaces and sheaves.</p>
<p>At the insistence of the &#8216;specialistes&#8217; (Serre, and Samuel who had just written his book &#8216;Méthodes d&#8217;algèbre abstraite en géométrie algébrique&#8217;) two additional points are adopted, but with some hesitation. The first being a jibe at Weil:<br />
1. &#8230;The congress, being a little disgusted by the artificiality of the generic point, does not want $K$ to be always of infinite transcendent degree over $k$. It admits that generic points are convenient in certain circumstances, but refuses to see them put to all the sauces: one could speak of a coordinate ring or of a  functionfield without stuffing it by force into $K$.<br />
2. Trying to include the arithmetic case.</p>
<p>The last point was problematic as all their algebras were supposed to be affine over a field $k$, and they wouldn&#8217;t go further than to allow the overfield $K$ to be its algebraic closure. Further, (and this caused a lot of heavy discussions at coming congresses) they allowed their varieties to be reducible.</p>
<p><strong>The Chicago congress (May 30th &#8211; June 2nd 1955)</strong></p>
<p>Apart from Samuel, a different group of Bourbakis gathered for the &#8216;second Caucus des Illinois&#8217; at Eckhart Hall, including three founding members Weil (then 49), Dixmier (then 49) and Chevalley (then 46), and two youngsters, Armand Borel (then 32) and Serge Lang (then 28).</p>
<p>Their reaction to the La Ciotat meeting (the &#8216;congress of the public bench&#8217;) was swift:</p>
<p>(page 1) : &#8220;The caucus discovered a public bench near Eckhart Hall, but didn&#8217;t do much with it.&#8221;<br />
(page 2) : &#8220;The caucus did not judge La Ciotat&#8217;s plan beyond reproach, and proposed a completely different plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>They wanted to include the arithmetic case by defining as affine scheme the set of all prime ideals (or rather, the localisations at these prime ideals) of a finitely generated domain over a Dedekind domain. They continue:</p>
<p>(page 4) : &#8220;The notion of a scheme covers the arithmetic case, and is extracted from the illustrious works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Nagata">Nagata</a>, themselves inspired by the scholarly cogitations of Chevalley. This means that the latter managed to sell all his ideas to the caucus. The Pope of Chicago, very happy to be able to reject very far projective varieties and Chow coordinates, willingly rallied to the suggestions of his illustrious colleague. However, we have not attempted to define varieties in the arithmetic case. Weil&#8217;s principle is that it is unclear what will come out of Nagata&#8217;s tricks, and that the only stable thing in arithmetic theory is reduction modulo $p$ a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goro_Shimura">Shimura</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Contrary to the decisions of La Ciotat, we do not want to glue reducible stuff, nor call them varieties. … We even decide to limit ourselves to absolutely irreducible varieties, which alone will have the right to the name of varieties.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insistence on absolutely irreducibility is understandable from Weil&#8217;s perspective as only they will have a generic point. But why does he go along with Chevalley&#8217;s proposal of an affine scheme?</p>
<p>In Weil&#8217;s approach, a point of the affine variety $V$ determined by a generic point $x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ determines a prime ideal $Q$ of the domain $R=k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, so Chevalley&#8217;s proposal to consider all prime ideals (rather than only the maximal ideals of an affine algebra) seems right to Weil.</p>
<p>However in Weil&#8217;s approach there are usually several points corresponding to the same prime ideal $Q$ of $R$, namely all possible embeddings of the ring $R/Q$ in that huge field $K$, so whenever $R/Q$ is not algebraic over $k$, there are infinitely Weil-points of $V$ corresponding to $Q$ (whence the La Ciotat criticism that points of a variety were not supposed to change at every moment).</p>
<p>According to Ralf Krömer in his book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-7643-7524-9">Tool and Object &#8211; a history and philosophy of category theory</a> this shift from Weil-points to prime ideals of $R$ may explain Chevalley&#8217;s use of the word &#8216;scheme&#8217;:</p>
<p>(page 164) : &#8220;The &#8216;scheme of the variety&#8217; denotes &#8216;what is invariant in a variety&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another time we will see how internal discussion influenced the further Bourbaki congresses until Grothendieck came up with his &#8216;hyperplan&#8217;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time of year I&#8217;m usually in France, or at least I was before Covid. This might explain for my recent obsession with French math YouTube interviews.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s first one is about Bourbaki&#8217;s golden years, the period between WW2 and 1975. Alain Connes is trying to get some anecdotes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Cartier_(mathematician)">Pierre Cartier</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have the time to sit through the whole thing, perhaps you might have a look at the discussion on whether or not to include categories in Bourbaki (starting at 51.40 into the clip).</p>

<p>Again, if you don&#8217;t have the energy to sit through it all, perhaps I can tempt you with Serre&#8217;s reaction to Connes bringing up the subject of toposes (starting at 14.36 into the clip).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No kidding, this is the final sentence of <a href="https://www.odilejacob.fr/catalogue/sciences/mathematiques/spectre-d-atacama_9782738141361.php">Le spectre d&#8217;Atacama</a>, the second novel by Alain Connes (written with  Danye Chéreau (IRL Mrs. AC) and his former Ph.D. advisor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a>).<br />
<center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/spectreConnes.jpg"> <img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/quantiqueConnes.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>The book has a promising start. Armand Lafforet (IRL AC) is summoned by his friend Rodrigo to the Chilean observatory <a href="http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/">Alma</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array">Altacama desert</a>. They have observed a mysterious spectrum, and need his advice.</p>
<p>Armand drops everything and on the flight he lectures the lady sitting next to him on proofs by induction (breaking up chocolate bars), and recalls a recent stay at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trappe_Abbey">La Trappe Abbey</a>, where he had an encounter with (the ghost of) Alexander Grothendieck, who urged him to &#8216;Follow the motif!&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comment était-il arrivé là? Il possédait surement quelques clés. Pourquoi pas celles des <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Clefsummary.pdf">songes</a>?&#8221; (How did he get<br />
 there? Surely he owned some keys, why not those of our dreams?)</p>
<p>A few pages further there&#8217;s this on the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos">topos</a> (my attempt to translate):</p>
<p>&#8220;The notion of space plays a central role in mathematics. Traditionally we represent it as a set of points, together with a notion of neighborhood that we call a &#8216;topology&#8217;. The universe of these new spaces, &#8216;toposes&#8217;, unveiled by Grothendieck, is marvellous, not only for the infinite wealth of examples (it contains, apart from the ordinary topological spaces, also numerous instances of a more combinatorial nature) but because of the totally original way to perceive space: instead of appearing on the main stage from the start, it hides backstage and manifests itself as a &#8216;deus ex machina&#8217;, introducing a variability in the theory of sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>We have a mystery, tidbits of mathematics, and allusions left there to put a smile on any Grothendieck-aficionado&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>But then, upon arrival, the story drops dead.</p>
<p>Rodrigo has been taken to hospital, and will remain incommunicado until well in the final quarter of the book.</p>
<p>As the remaining astronomers show little interest in Alain&#8217;s (sorry, Armand&#8217;s) first lecture, he decides to skip the second, and departs on a hike to the ocean. There, he takes a genuine sailing ship in true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne">Jules Verne</a> style to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lighthouse_at_the_End_of_the_World">lighthouse at he end of the world</a>.</p>
<p>All this drags on for at least half a year in time, and two thirds of the book&#8217;s length. We are left in complete suspense when it comes to the mysterious Atacama spectrum.</p>
<p>Perhaps the three authors deliberately want to break with existing conventions of story telling?</p>
<p>I had a similar feeling when reading their first novel <a href="https://www.odilejacob.fr/catalogue/sciences/mathematiques/theatre-quantique_9782738129833.php">Le Theatre Quantique</a>. Here they spend some effort to flesh out their heroine, Charlotte, in the first part of the book. But then, all of a sudden, their main character is replaced by a detective, and next by a computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, when Armand finally reappears at the IHES the story picks up pace.</p>
<p>The trio (Armand, his would-be-lover Charlotte, and Ali Ravi, Cern&#8217;s computer guru) convince <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> to sell its main computer to an American billionaire with the (fake) promise of developing a quantum computer. Incidentally, they somehow manage to do this using Charlotte&#8217;s history with that computer (for this, you have to read &#8216;Le Theatre Quantique&#8217;).</p>
<p>By their quantum-computing power (Shor and quantum-encryption pass the revue) they are able to decipher the Atacame spectrum (something to do with primes and zeroes of the zeta function), send coded messages using quantum entanglement, end up in the Oval Office and convince the president to send a message to the &#8216;Riemann sphere&#8217; (another fun pun), and so on, and on.</p>
<p>The book ends with a twist of the classic tale of the mathematician willing to sell his soul to the devil for a (dis)proof of the Riemann hypothesis:</p>
<p>After spending some time in purgatory, the mathematician gets a meeting with God and asks her <strong>the</strong> question &#8220;Is the Riemann hypothesis true?&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&#8221;, God says.</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can you know that all non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function have real part 1/2?&#8221;, Armand asks.</p>
<p>And God replies:</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple enough, I can see them all at once. But then, don&#8217;t forget I&#8217;m God. I can see the disappointment in your face, yes I can read in your heart that you are frustrated, that you desire an explanation&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;re going to fix this. I will call archangel Gabriel, the angel of geometry, he will make you a topos!&#8221;</p>
<p>If you feel like running to the nearest Kindle store to buy &#8220;Le spectre d&#8217;Atacama&#8221;, make sure to opt for a package deal. It is impossible to make heads or tails of the story without reading &#8220;Le theatre quantique&#8221; first.</p>
<p>But then, there are worse ways to spend an idle week than by binge reading Connes&#8230;</p>
