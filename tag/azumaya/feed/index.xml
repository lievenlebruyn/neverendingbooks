					<description><![CDATA[For any finite dimensional A-representation S we defined before a character $\chi(S) $ which is an linear functional on the noncommutative functions $\mathfrak{g}_A = A/[A,A]_{vect}&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For any finite dimensional A-representation S we <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/?p=38">defined before</a> a <strong>character</strong> $\chi(S) $ which is an linear functional on the <strong>noncommutative functions</strong> $\mathfrak{g}_A = A/[A,A]_{vect} $ and defined via</p>
<p>$\chi_a(S) = Tr(a | S) $ for all $a \in A $</p>
<p>We would like to have enough such characters to separate simples, that is we would like to have an embedding</p>
<p>$\mathbf{simp}~A \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{g}_A^* $</p>
<p>from the set of all finite dimensional simple A-representations $\mathbf{simp}~A $ into the linear dual of $\mathfrak{g}_A^* $. This is a consequence of the celebrated <strong>Artin-Procesi theorem</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/artin.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" hspace=10 /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Artin">Michael Artin</a> was the first person to approach representation theory via algebraic geometry and geometric invariant theory. In his 1969 classical paper &#8220;On Azumaya algebras and finite dimensional representations of rings&#8221; he introduced the affine scheme $\mathbf{rep}_n~A $ of all n-dimensional representations of A on which the group $GL_n $ acts via basechange, the orbits of which are exactly the isomorphism classes of representations. He went on to use the Hilbert criterium in invariant theory to prove that the closed orbits for this action are exactly the isomorphism classes of <strong>semi-simple</strong> -dimensional representations. Invariant theory tells us that there are enough invariant polynomials to separate closed orbits, so we would be done if the caracters would generate the ring of invariant polynmials, a statement first conjectured in this paper.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/procesi.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" hspace=10 /> <a href="http://www.mat.uniroma1.it/~procesi/">Claudio Procesi</a> was able to prove this conjecture in his 1976 paper &#8220;The invariant theory of $n \times n $ matrices&#8221; in which he reformulated the fundamental theorems on $GL_n $-invariants to show that the ring of invariant polynomials of m $n \times n $ matrices under simultaneous conjugation is generated by traces of words in the matrices (and even managed to limit the number of letters in the words required to $n^2+1 $). Using the properties of the Reynolds operator in invariant theory it then follows that the same applies to the $GL_n $-action on the representation schemes $\mathbf{rep}_n~A $.</p>
<p>So, let us reformulate their result a bit. Assume the affine $\mathbb{C} $-algebra A is generated by the elements $a_1,\ldots,a_m $ then we define a <strong>necklace</strong> to be an equivalence class of words in the $a_i $, where two words are equivalent iff they are the same upto <strong>cyclic</strong> permutation of letters. For example $a_1a_2^2a_1a_3 $ and $a_2a_1a_3a_1a_2 $ determine the same necklace. Remark that traces of different words corresponding to the same necklace have the same value and that the noncommutative functions $\mathfrak{g}_A $ are spanned by necklaces.</p>
<p>The <strong>Artin-Procesi theorem</strong> then asserts that if S and T are non-isomorphic simple A-representations, then $\chi(S) \not= \chi(T) $ as elements of $\mathfrak{g}_A^* $ and even that they differ on a necklace in the generators of A of length at most $n^2+1 $. Phrased differently, the array of characters of simples evaluated at necklaces is a substitute for the clasical character-table in finite group theory.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time we have seen that the noncommutative manifold of a Riemann surface can be viewed as that Riemann surface together with a loop in&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/noncRiemann2.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:10px;"> <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/?p=76">Last time</a> we have<br />
seen that the noncommutative manifold of a Riemann surface can be viewed<br />
as that Riemann surface together with a loop in each point. The extra<br />
loop-structure tells us that all finite dimensional representations of<br />
the coordinate ring can be found by separating over points and those<br />
living at just one point are classified by the isoclasses of nilpotent<br />
matrices, that is are parametrized by the partitions (corresponding<br />
to the sizes of the Jordan blocks). In addition, these loops tell us<br />
that the Riemann surface locally looks like a Riemann sphere, so an<br />
equivalent mental picture of the local structure of this<br />
noncommutative manifold is given by  the picture on teh left,  where the surface is part of the Riemann surface<br />
and a sphere is placed at every point.  Today we will consider<br />
genuine noncommutative curves and describe their corresponding<br />
noncommutative manifolds.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/noncSphere.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;"> Here, a mental picture of such a<br />
_noncommutative sphere_ to keep in mind would be something<br />
like  the picture on the right.  That is, in most points of the sphere we place as before again<br />
a Riemann sphere but in a finite number of points a different phenomen<br />
occurs : we get a <strong>cluster of infinitesimally nearby points</strong>. We<br />
will explain this picture with an easy example.  Consider the<br />
complex plane $\mathbb{C} $, the points of which are just the<br />
one-dimensional representations of the polynomial algebra in one<br />
variable $\mathbb{C}[z] $ (any algebra map $\mathbb{C}[z] \rightarrow \mathbb{C} $ is fully determined by the image of z). On this plane we<br />
have an automorphism of order two sending a complex number z to its<br />
negative -z (so this automorphism can be seen as a point-reflexion<br />
with center the zero element 0). This automorphism extends to<br />
the polynomial algebra, again induced by sending z to -z. That<br />
is, the image of a polynomial $f(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z] $ under this<br />
automorphism is f(-z).</p>
<p>With this data we can form a noncommutative<br />
algebra, the _skew-group algebra_  $\mathbb{C}[z] \ast C_2 $ the<br />
elements of which are either of the form $f(z) \ast e $ or $g(z) \ast g $ where<br />
$C_2 = \langle g : g^2=e \rangle $ is the cyclic group of order two<br />
generated by the automorphism g and f(z),g(z) are arbitrary<br />
polynomials in z.</p>
<p>The multiplication on this algebra is determined by<br />
the following rules </p>
<p>$(g(z) \ast g)(f(z) \ast e) = g(z)f(-z) \astg $ whereas $(f(z) \ast e)(g(z) \ast g) = f(z)g(z) \ast g $</p>
<p>$(f(z) \ast e)(g(z) \ast e) = f(z)g(z) \ast e $ whereas $(f(z) \ast g)(g(z)\ast g) = f(z)g(-z) \ast e $</p>
<p>That is, multiplication in the<br />
$\mathbb{C}[z] $ factor is the usual multiplication, multiplication in<br />
the $C_2 $ factor is the usual group-multiplication but when we want<br />
to get a polynomial from right to left over a group-element we have to<br />
apply the corresponding automorphism to the polynomial (thats why we<br />
call it a _skew_ group-algebra).</p>
<p>Alternatively, remark that as<br />
a $\mathbb{C} $-algebra the skew-group algebra $\mathbb{C}[z] \ast C_2 $ is<br />
an algebra with unit element 1 = 1\aste and is generated by<br />
the elements $X = z \ast e $ and $Y = 1 \ast g $ and that the defining<br />
relations of the multiplication are </p>
<p>$Y^2 = 1 $ and $Y.X =-X.Y $ </p>
<p>hence another description would<br />
be</p>
<p>$\mathbb{C}[z] \ast C_2 = \frac{\mathbb{C} \langle X,Y \rangle}{ (Y^2-1,XY+YX) } $</p>
<p>It can be shown that skew-group<br />
algebras over the coordinate ring of smooth curves are _noncommutative<br />
smooth algebras_ whence there is a noncommutative manifold associated<br />
to them. Recall from last time  <strong>the noncommutative manifold of a<br />
smooth algebra A is a device to classify all finite dimensional<br />
representations of A upto isomorphism</strong>  Let us therefore try to<br />
determine some of these representations, starting with the<br />
one-dimensional ones, that is, algebra maps from</p>
<p>$\mathbb{C}[z] \ast C_2 = \frac{\mathbb{C} \langle X,Y \rangle}{ (Y^2-1,XY+YX) } \rightarrow \mathbb{C} $</p>
<p>Such a map is determined by the image of X and that of<br />
Y. Now, as $Y^2=1 $ we have just two choices for the image of Y<br />
namely +1 or -1. But then, as the image is a commutative algebra<br />
and as XY+YX=0 we must have that the image of 2XY is zero whence the<br />
image of X must be zero. That is, we have <strong>only<br />
two</strong> one-dimensional representations, namely  $S_+ : X \rightarrow 0, Y \rightarrow 1 $<br />
and $S_- : X \rightarrow 0, Y \rightarrow -1 $</p>
<p>This is odd! Can<br />
it be that our noncommutative manifold has just 2 points? Of course not.<br />
In fact, these two points are the exceptional ones giving us a cluster<br />
of nearby points (see below) whereas most points of our<br />
noncommutative manifold will correspond to 2-dimensional<br />
representations!</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s hunt them down.    The<br />
<strong>center</strong> of $\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 $ (that is, the elements commuting with<br />
all others) consists of all elements of the form $f(z)\ast e $ with f an<br />
_even_ polynomial, that is, f(z)=f(-z) (because it has to commute<br />
with 1\ast g), so is equal to the subalgebra $\mathbb{C}[z^2]\ast e $.</p>
<p>The<br />
manifold corresponding to this subring is again the complex plane<br />
$\mathbb{C} $ of which the points correspond to all one-dimensional<br />
representations of $\mathbb{C}[z^2]\ast e $ (determined by the image of<br />
$z^2\ast e $).</p>
<p>We will now show that to each point of $\mathbb{C} &#8211; &#123; 0 &#125; $<br />
corresponds a <strong>simple 2-dimensional representation</strong> of<br />
$\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 $.</p>
<p>If a is not zero, we will consider the<br />
quotient of the skew-group algebra modulo the twosided ideal generated<br />
by $z^2\ast e-a $. It turns out<br />
that</p>
<p>$\frac{\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2}{(z^2\aste-a)} =<br />
\frac{\mathbb{C}[z]}{(z^2-a)} \ast C_2 = (\frac{\mathbb{C}[z]}{(z-\sqrt{a})}<br />
\oplus \frac{\mathbb{C}[z]}{(z+\sqrt{a})}) \ast C_2 = (\mathbb{C}<br />
\oplus \mathbb{C}) \ast C_2 $</p>
<p>where the skew-group algebra on the<br />
right is given by the automorphism g on $\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C} $ interchanging the two factors. If you want to<br />
become more familiar with working in skew-group algebras work out the<br />
details of the fact that there is an algebra-isomorphism between<br />
$(\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}) \ast C_2 $ and the algebra of $2 \times 2 $ matrices $M_2(\mathbb{C}) $. Here is the<br />
identification</p>
<p>$~(1,0)\aste \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $</p>
<p>$~(0,1)\aste \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} $</p>
<p>$~(1,0)\astg \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $</p>
<p>$~(0,1)\astg \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $</p>
<p>so you have to verify that multiplication<br />
on the left hand side (that is in $(\mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}) \ast<br />
C_2 $) coincides with matrix-multiplication of the associated<br />
matrices.</p>
<p>Okay, this begins to look like what we are after. To<br />
every point of the complex plane minus zero (or to every point of the<br />
Riemann sphere minus the two points $&#123; 0,\infty &#125; $) we have<br />
associated a two-dimensional simple representation of the skew-group<br />
algebra (btw. simple means that the matrices determined by the images<br />
of X and Y generate the whole matrix-algebra).</p>
<p>In fact, we<br />
now have already classified <strong>&#8216;most&#8217;</strong> of the finite dimensional<br />
representations of $\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 $, namely those n-dimensional<br />
representations </p>
<p>$\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 =<br />
\frac{\mathbb{C} \langle X,Y \rangle}{(Y^2-1,XY+YX)} \rightarrow M_n(\mathbb{C}) $</p>
<p>for which the image of X is an invertible $n \times n $ matrix. We can show that such representations only exist when<br />
n is an even number, say n=2m and that any such representation is<br />
again determined by the geometric/combinatorial data we found last time<br />
for a Riemann surface.</p>
<p>That is,  It is determined by a finite<br />
number $&#123; P_1,\dots,P_k &#125; $ of points from $\mathbb{C} &#8211; 0 $ where<br />
k is at most m. For each index i we have a positive<br />
number $a_i $ such that $a_1+\dots+a_k=m $ and finally for each i we<br />
also have a partition of $a_i $.</p>
<p>That is our noncommutative<br />
manifold looks like all points of $\mathbb{C}-0 $ with one loop in each<br />
point. However, we have to remember that each point now determines a<br />
simple 2-dimensional representation and that in order to get all<br />
finite dimensional representations with det(X) non-zero we have to<br />
<strong>scale up</strong> representations of $\mathbb{C}[z^2] $ by a factor two.<br />
The technical term here is that of a <strong>Morita equivalence</strong> (or that the<br />
noncommutative algebra is an <strong>Azumaya algebra</strong> over<br />
$\mathbb{C}-0 $).</p>
<p>What about the remaining representations, that<br />
is, those for which Det(X)=0? We have already seen that there are two<br />
1-dimensional representations $S_+ $ and $S_- $ lying over 0, so how<br />
do they fit in our noncommutative manifold? Should we consider them as<br />
two points and draw also a loop in each of them or do we have to do<br />
something different?  Rememer that drawing a loop means in our<br />
<strong>geometry -> representation</strong> dictionary that the representations<br />
living at that point are classified in the same way as nilpotent<br />
matrices.</p>
<p>Hence, drawing a loop in $S_+ $ would mean that we have a<br />
2-dimensional representation of $\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 $ (different from<br />
$S_+ \oplus S_+ $) and any such representation must correspond to<br />
matrices </p>
<p>$X \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $ and $Y \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} $</p>
<p>But this is not possible as these matrices do<br />
_not_ satisfy the relation XY+YX=0. Hence, there is no loop in $S_+ $<br />
and similarly also no loop in $S_- $.</p>
<p>However, there are non<br />
semi-simple two dimensional representations build out of the simples<br />
$S_+ $ and $S_- $. For, consider the matrices </p>
<p>$X \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} $ and $Y \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix} $</p>
<p>then these<br />
matrices _do_ satisfy XY+YX=0! (and there is another matrix-pair<br />
interchanging $\pm 1 $ in the Y-matrix). In erudite terminology this<br />
says that there is a _nontrivial extension_ between $S_+ $ and $S_- $<br />
and one between $S_- $ and $S_+ $.</p>
<p>In our dictionary we will encode this<br />
information by the picture</p>
<p>$\xymatrix{\vtx{}<br />
\ar@/^2ex/[rr] &amp; &amp; \vtx{} \ar@/^2ex/[ll]} $</p>
<p>where the two<br />
vertices correspond to the points $S_+ $ and $S_- $ and the arrows<br />
represent the observed extensions. In fact, this data suffices to finish<br />
our classification project of finite dimensional representations of<br />
the noncommutative curve $\mathbb{C}[z] \ast C_2 $.</p>
<p>Those with Det(X)=0<br />
are of the form : $R \oplus T $ where R is a representation with<br />
invertible X-matrix (which we classified before) and T is a direct<br />
sum of representations involving only the simple factors $S_+ $ and<br />
$S_- $ and obtained by iterating the 2-dimensional idea. That is, for<br />
each factor the Y-matrix has alternating $\pm 1 $ along the diagonal<br />
and the X-matrix is the full nilpotent Jordan-matrix.</p>
<p>So<br />
here is our picture of the <strong>noncommutative manifold of the<br />
noncommutative curve $\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 $</strong> : the points are all points<br />
of $\mathbb{C}-0 $ together with one loop in each of them together<br />
with two points lying over 0 where we draw the above picture of arrows<br />
between them. One should view these two points as lying<br />
infinetesimally close to each other and the gluing<br />
data</p>
<p>$\xymatrix{\vtx{} \ar@/^2ex/[rr] &amp; &amp; \vtx{}<br />
\ar@/^2ex/[ll]} $</p>
<p>contains enough information to determine<br />
that all other points of the noncommutative manifold in the vicinity of<br />
this cluster should be two dimensional simples!  The methods used<br />
in this simple minded example are strong enough to determine the<br />
structure of the noncommutative manifold of _any_ noncommutative curve.</p>

So, let us look at a real-life example. Once again, take the<br />
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/klein.html">Kleinian quartic</a>    In a previous<br />
<a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/?p=64">course-post</a> we recalled that<br />
there is an action by automorphisms on the Klein quartic K by the<br />
finite simple group $PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_7) $ of order 168. Hence, we<br />
can form the <strong>noncommutative Klein-quartic</strong> $K \ast PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_7) $<br />
(take affine pieces consisting of complements of orbits and do the<br />
skew-group algebra construction on them and then glue these pieces<br />
together again).</p>
<p>We have also seen that the orbits are classified<br />
under a Belyi-map $K \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}} $ and that this map<br />
had the property that over any point of $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}<br />
&#8211; &#123; 0,1,\infty &#125; $ there is an orbit consisting of 168 points<br />
whereas over 0 (resp. 1 and $\infty $) there is an orbit<br />
consisting of 56 (resp. 84 and 24 points).</p>
<p>So what is<br />
the noncommutative manifold associated to the noncommutative Kleinian?<br />
Well, it looks like the picture we had at the start of this<br />
post  <img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/noncSphere.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" />   For all but three points of the Riemann sphere<br />
$\mathbb{P}^1 &#8211; &#123; 0,1,\infty &#125; $ we have one point and one loop<br />
(corresponding to a simple 168-dimensional representation of $K \ast<br />
PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_7) $) together with clusters of infinitesimally nearby<br />
points lying over 0,1 and $\infty $ (the cluster over 0<br />
is depicted, the two others only indicated).</p>
<p>Over 0 we have<br />
three points connected by the diagram</p>
<p>$\xymatrix{&amp; \vtx{} \ar[ddl] &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; \\ \vtx{} \ar[rr] &amp; &amp; \vtx{} \ar[uul]} $</p>
<p>where each of the vertices corresponds to a<br />
simple 56-dimensional representation. Over 1 we have a cluster of<br />
two points corresponding to 84-dimensional simples and connected by<br />
the picture we had in the $\mathbb{C}[z]\ast C_2 $ example).</p>
<p>Finally,<br />
over $\infty $ we have the most interesting cluster, consisting of the<br />
seven dwarfs (each corresponding to a simple representation of dimension<br />
24) and connected to each other via the<br />
picture</p>
<p>$\xymatrix{&amp; &amp; \vtx{} \ar[dll] &amp; &amp; \\ \vtx{} \ar[d] &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \vtx{} \ar[ull] \\ \vtx{} \ar[dr] &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \vtx{} \ar[u] \\ &amp; \vtx{} \ar[rr] &amp; &amp; \vtx{} \ar[ur] &amp;} $</p>
<p>Again, this noncommutative manifold gives us<br />
all information needed to give a complete classification of all finite<br />
dimensional $K \ast PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_7) $-representations.  One<br />
can prove that all exceptional clusters of points for a noncommutative<br />
curve are connected by a cyclic quiver as the ones above. However, these<br />
examples are still pretty tame (in more than one sense) as these<br />
noncommutative algebras are finite over their centers, are Noetherian<br />
etc. The situation will become a lot wilder when we come to exotic<br />
situations such as the noncommutative manifold of<br />
$SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $&#8230;</p>

<p>It is far from finished but you can already visit a demo-version of<br />
<a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/toolkit/pdfdir.php?dir=%2FTheLibrary%2F">TheLibrary</a> which I hope will one day be a useful collection of<br />
online courses and books on non-commutative algebra &amp; geometry. At<br />
the moment it just contains a few of my own things but I do hope that<br />
others will find the format interesting enough to allow me to include<br />
their courses and/or books. So, please try this demo out! But before you<br />
do, make sure that you have a good webbrowser-plugin to view<br />
PDF-documents from within your browser (rather than having to download<br />
the files). If you are using Macintosh 10.3 or better there is a very<br />
nice <a href="http://www.schubert-it.com/pluginpdf/">plugin</a> freely<br />
available whch you only have to drag into your _/Library/Internet<br />
Plug-Ins/_-folder to get it working (after restarting Safari). <br
/> If you click on the title you will get a page with hyper-links to all<br />
bookmarks of the pdf-file (for example, if you have used the <a href="http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/">hyperref</a> package to<br />
(La)TeX your file, you get these bookmarks for free). If you only have a<br />
PDF-file you can always include the required bookmarks using <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html">Acrobat</a>. <br
/> No doubt the most useful feature (at this moment) of the set-up is<br />
that all files are fully searchable for keywords. <br /> For example, if<br />
you are at the page of my <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/toolkit/pdffile.php?pdf=%2FTheLibrary%2Fcourses%2F3talks.pdf">3 talks on noncommutative<br />
geometry@n</a>-course and fill out &#8220;Azumaya&#8221; in the Search<br />
Document-field you will get a screen like the one below  </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/libscreenshot.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>That is, you wlll get all occurrences of &#39;Azumaya&#39; in<br />
the document together with some of the context as well as page- or<br />
section-links nearby that you can click to get to the paragraph you are<br />
looking for. In the weeks to come I hope to extend the usability of<br />
_TheLibrary_ by offering a one-page view, modular security<br />
enhancements, a commenting feature as well as a popularity count. But,<br />
as always, this may take longer than I want&#8230; <br /> If you think<br />
that the present set-up might already be of interest to readers of your<br />
courses or books and if you have a good PDF-file of it available<br />
(including bookmarks) then email  and we will try to include your<br />
material!</p>

<p>One way to increase the <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=https://lievenlb.local/">blogshare-value</a> of this site might be to<br />
  give readers more of what they want. In fact, there is an excellent<br />
  guide for those who really want to increase traffic on their site<br />
  called <a href="http://www.searchengineworld.com/misc/guide.htm">26<br />
  Steps to 15k a Day</a>. A somewhat sobering suggestion is rule S :
  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Think about what people want. They<br />
  aren&#39;t coming to your site to view &#8220;your content&#8221;,<br />
  they are coming to your site looking for &#8220;their<br />
  content&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do we know what<br />
  people want? Well, by paying attention to Google-referrals according<br />
  to rule U :  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The search engines will<br />
  tell you exactly what they want to be fed &#8211; listen closely, there is<br />
  gold in referral logs, it&#39;s just a matter of panning for<br />
  it.&#8221;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what do these Google-referrals<br />
  show over the last couple of days? Well, here are the top recent<br />
  key-words given to Google to get here :  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 :<br />
  carolyn dean jacobian conjecture <br />   11 : carolyn dean jacobian<br />
  <br />   9 : brauer severi varieties <br />   7 : latexrender <br />

  azumaya <br />   6 : [Unparseable or potentially dangerous latex<br />
  formula Error 6 ] <br />   6 : jacobian conjecture carolyn dean  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>See a pattern? People love to hear right now about<br />
  the solution of the Jacobian conjecture in the plane by Carolyn Dean.<br />
  Fortunately, there are a couple of things more I can say about this<br />
  and it may take a while before you know why there is a photo of Tracy<br />
  Chapman next to this post&#8230;  </p>
<p>First, it seems I only got<br />
  part of the <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;group=sci.math.research&amp;selm=d29cmre258j5%40legacy">Melvin Hochster<br />
  email</a>. Here is the final part I was unaware of (thanks to <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/">not even wrong</a>)
  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Earlier papers established the following: if<br />
  there is <br />   a counterexample, the leading forms of $f$ and $g$<br />
  may <br />   be assumed to have the form $(x^a y^b)^J$ and $(x^a<br />
  y^b)^K$, <br />   where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime and neither<br />
  $J$ <br />   nor $K$ divides the other (Abhyankar, 1977). It is known<br />
  that <br />   $a$ and $b$ cannot both be $1$ (Lang, 1991) and that one<br />
  may <br />   assume that $C[f,g]$ does not contain a degree one<br />
  polynomial <br />   in $x, y$ (Formanek, 1994).  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let $D_x$ and $D_y$ indicate partial differentiation with respect<br />
  <br /> to $x$ and $y$, respectively. A difficult result of Bass (1989)<br />
  <br /> asserts that if $D$ is a non-zero operator that is a polynomial<br />
  <br /> over $C$ in $x D_x$ and $y D_y$, $G$ is in $C[x,y]$ and $D(G)$<br />
  <br /> is in $C[f,g]$, then $G$ is in $C[f,g]$.  </p>
<p>The proof<br />
  proceeds by starting with $f$ and $g$ that give <br /> a<br />
  counterexample, and recursively constructing sequences of <br />
  elements and derivations with remarkable, intricate and <br />
  surprising relationships. Ultimately, a contradiction is <br />
  obtained by studying a sequence of positive integers associated <br />
  with the degrees of the elements constructed. One delicate <br />
  argument shows that the sequence is bounded. Another delicate <br />
  argument shows that it is not. Assuming the results described <br />
  above, the proof, while complicated, is remarkably self-contained <br
  /> and can be understood with minimal background in algebra.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Mel Hochster</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking about the Jacobian<br />
  conjecture-post at <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/blog/">not even wrong</a> and<br />
  the discussion in the comments to it : there were a few instances I<br />
  really wanted to join in but I&#39;ll do it here. To begin, I was a<br />
  bit surprised of the implicit attack in the post  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dean hasn&#39;t published any papers in almost 15 years and is<br />
  nominally a lecturer in mathematics education at Michigan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this was immediately addressed and retracted in<br />
  the comments :  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just curious. What exactly did<br />
  you mean by &#8220;nominally a lecturer&#8221;? <br />   Posted by mm<br />
  at November 10, 2004 10:54 PM  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know<br />
  anything about Carolyn Dean personally, just that one place on the<br />
  Michigan web-site refers to her as a &#8220;lecturer&#8221;, another<br />
  as a &#8220;visiting lecturer&#8221;. As I&#39;m quite well aware from<br />
  personal experience, these kinds of titles can refer to all sorts of<br />
  different kinds of actual positions. So the title doesn&#39;t tell you<br />
  much, which is what I was awkwardly expressing. <br /> Posted by Peter<br />
  at November 10, 2004 11:05 PM  </p>
<p>Well, I know a few things<br />
  about Carolyn Dean personally, the most relevant being that she is a<br />
  very careful mathematician. I met her a while back (fall of 1985) at<br />
  UCSD where she was finishing (or had finished) her Ph.D. If Lance<br />
  Small&#39;s description of me would have been more reassuring, we<br />
  might even have ended up sharing an apartment (quod non). Instead I<br />
  ended up with <a href="http://venere.mat.uniroma1.it/people/procesi/">Claudio<br />
  Procesi</a>&#8230; Anyway, it was a very enjoyable month with a group<br />
  of young starting mathematicians and I fondly remember some<br />
  dinner-parties we organized. The last news I heard about Carolyn was<br />
  10 to 15 years ago in Oberwolfach when it was rumoured that she had<br />
  solved the Jacobian conjecture in the plane&#8230; As far as I recall,<br />
  the method sketched by Hochster in his email was also the one back<br />
  then. Unfortunately, at the time she still didn&#39;t have all pieces<br />
  in place and a gap was found (was it by Toby Stafford? or was it<br />
  Hochster?, I forgot). Anyway, she promptly acknowledged that there was<br />
  a gap. <br /> At the time I was dubious about the approach (mostly<br />
  because I was secretly trying to solve it myself) but today my gut<br />
  feeling is that she really did solve it. In recent years there have<br />
  been significant advances in polynomial automorphisms (in particular<br />
  the tame-wild problem) and in the study of the Hilbert scheme of<br />
  points in the plane (which I always thought might lead to a proof) so<br />
  perhaps some of these recent results did give Carolyn clues to finish<br />
  off her old approach? I haven&#39;t seen one letter of the proof so<br />
  I&#39;m merely speculating here. Anyway, Hochster&#39;s assurance that<br />
  the proof is correct is good enough for me right now. <br /> Another<br />
  discussion in the NotEvenWrong-comments was on the issue that several<br />
  old problems were recently solved by people who devoted themselves for<br />
  several years solely to that problem and didn&#39;t join the parade of<br />
  dedicated follower of fashion-mathematicians.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is remarkable that the last decade has seen great progress in<br />
  math (Wiles proving Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem, Perelman proving the<br />
  Poincare Conjecture, now Dean the Jacobian Conjecture), all achieved<br />
  by people willing to spend 7 years or more focusing on a single<br />
  problem. That&#39;s not the way academic research is generally<br />
  structured, if you want grants, etc. you should be working on much<br />
  shorter term projects. It&#39;s also remarkable that two out of three<br />
  of these people didn&#39;t have a regular tenured position.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think particle theory should learn from this. If<br />
  some of the smarter people in the field would actually spend 7 years<br />
  concentrating on one problem, the field might actually go somewhere<br />
  instead of being dead in the water <br /> Posted by Peter at November<br />
  13, 2004 08:56 AM</p>
<p>Here we come close to a major problem of<br />
  today&#39;s mathematics. I have the feeling that far too few<br />
  mathematicians dedicate themselves to problems in which they have a<br />
  personal interest, independent of what the rest of the world might<br />
  think about these problems. Far too many resort to doing trendy,<br />
  technical mathematics merely because it is approved by so called<br />
  &#39;better&#39; mathematicians. Mind you, I admit that I did fall in<br />
  that trap myself several times but lately I feel quite relieved to be<br />
  doing just the things I like to do no matter what the rest may think<br />
  about it. Here is a little bit of advice to some colleagues : get<br />
  yourself an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> and take<br />
  some time to listen to songs like this one :  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t be tempted by the shiny apple <br />   Don&#39;t you eat<br />
  of a bitter fruit <br />   Hunger only for a taste of justice <br />
  Hunger only for a world of truth <br />   &#39;Cause all that you have<br />
  is your soul  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>from Tracy Chapman&#39;s <a href="http://www.lyricscafe.com/c/chapman_tracy/crossroads_10.htm">All<br />
  that you have is your soul</a></p>

<p>One of the things I like most about returning from a vacation is to<br />
have an enormous pile of fresh reading : a week&#39;s worth of<br />
newspapers, some regular mail and much more email (three quarters junk).<br />
Also before getting into bed after the ride I like to browse through the<br />
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> in search for interesting<br />
papers. <br /> This time, the major surprise of my initial survey came<br />
from the newspapers. No, not Bush again, _that_ news was headline<br />
even in France. On the other hand, I didn&#39;t hear a word about <a
href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3974179.stm"> Theo Van<br />
Gogh being shot and stabbed to death</a> in Amsterdam. I&#39;ll come<br />
back to this later. <br /> I&#39;d rather mention the two papers that<br />
somehow stood out during my scan of this week on the arXiv. The first is<br />
<a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0411101">Framed quiver moduli,<br />
cohomology, and quantum groups</a> by <a href="http://www.math.uni-muenster.de/reine/u/reinekem/">Markus<br />
Reineke</a>. By the deframing trick, a framed quiver moduli problem is<br />
reduced to an ordinary quiver moduli problem for a dimension vector for<br />
which one of the entries is equal to one, hence in particular, an<br />
indivisible dimension vector. Such quiver problems are far easier to<br />
handle than the divisible ones where everything can at best be reduced<br />
to the classical problem of classifying tuples of $n \\times n$ matrices<br />
up to simultaneous conjugation. Markus deals with the case when the<br />
quiver has no oriented cycles. An important examples of a framed moduli<br />
quiver problem _with_ oriented cycles is the study of<br />
Brauer-Severi varieties of smooth orders. Significant progress on the<br />
description of the fibers in this case is achieved by Raf Bocklandt,<br />
Stijn Symens and Geert Van de Weyer and will (hopefully) be posted soon.<br />
<br /> The second paper is <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0411094">Moduli schemes of rank<br />
one Azumaya modules</a> by Norbert Hoffmann and Urich Stuhler which<br />
brings back longforgotten memories of my Ph.D. thesis, 21 years<br />
ago&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Last time][1] we saw that for $A$ a smooth order with center $R$ the<br />
Brauer-Severi variety $X_A$ is a smooth variety and we have a projective<br />
morphism      $X_A \rightarrow \mathbf{max}~R$      This situation is<br />
very similar to that of a desingularization $~X \rightarrow<br />
\mathbf{max}~R$ of the (possibly singular) variety $~\mathbf{max}~R$.<br />
The top variety $~X$ is a smooth variety and there is a Zariski open<br />
subset of $~\mathbf{max}~R$ where the fibers of this map consist of just<br />
one point, or in more bombastic language a $~\mathbb{P}^0$. The only<br />
difference in the case of the Brauer-Severi fibration is that we have a<br />
Zariski open subset of $~\mathbf{max}~R$ (the Azumaya locus of A) where<br />
the fibers of the fibration are isomorphic to $~\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. In<br />
this way one might view the Brauer-Severi fibration of a smooth order as<br />
a non-commutative or hyper-desingularization of the central variety.<br />
 This might provide a way to attack the old problem of construction<br />
desingularizations of quiver-quotients. If $~Q$ is a quiver and $\alpha$<br />
is an indivisible dimension vector (that is, the component dimensions<br />
are coprime) then it is well known (a result due to [Alastair King][2])<br />
that for a generic stability structure $\theta$ the moduli space<br />
$~M^{\theta}(Q,\alpha)$ classifying $\theta$-semistable<br />
$\alpha$-dimensional representations will be a smooth variety (as all<br />
$\theta$-semistables are actually $\theta$-stable) and the fibration<br />
 $~M^{\theta}(Q,\alpha) \rightarrow \mathbf{iss}_{\alpha}~Q$      is a<br />
desingularization of the quotient-variety $~\mathbf{iss}_{\alpha}~Q$<br />
classifying isomorphism classes of $\alpha$-dimensional semi-simple<br />
representations.      However, if $\alpha$ is not indivisible nobody has<br />
the faintest clue as to how to construct a natural desingularization of<br />
$~\mathbf{iss}_{\alpha}~Q$. Still, we have a perfectly reasonable<br />
hyper-desingularization      $~X_{A(Q,\alpha)} \rightarrow<br />
\mathbf{iss}_{\alpha}~Q$      where $~A(Q,\alpha)$ is the corresponding<br />
quiver order, the generic fibers of which are all projective spaces in<br />
case $\alpha$ is the dimension vector of a simple representation of<br />
$~Q$. I conjecture (meaning : I hope) that this Brauer-Severi fibration<br />
contains already a lot of information on a genuine desingularization of<br />
$~\mathbf{iss}_{\alpha}~Q$.      One obvious test for this seemingly<br />
crazy conjecture is to study the flat locus of the Brauer-Severi<br />
fibration. If it would contain info about desingularizations one would<br />
expect that the fibration can never be flat in a central singularity! In<br />
other words, we would like that the flat locus of the fibration is<br />
contained in the smooth central locus. This is indeed the case and is a<br />
more or less straightforward application of the proof (due to [Geert Van<br />
de Weyer][3]) of the Popov-conjecture for quiver-quotients (see for<br />
example his Ph.D. thesis [Nullcones of quiver representations][4]).<br />
However, it is in general not true that the flat-locus and central<br />
smooth locus coincide.      Sometimes this is because the Brauer-Severi<br />
scheme is a blow-up of the Brauer-Severi of a nicer order. The following<br />
example was worked out together with [Colin Ingalls][5] : Consider the<br />
order      $~A = \begin{bmatrix} C[x,y] &#038; C[x,y] \\ (x,y) &#038; C[x,y]<br />
\end{bmatrix}$      which is the quiver order of the quiver setting<br />
$~(Q,\alpha)$      $\xymatrix{\vtx{1} \ar@/^2ex/[rr] \ar@/^1ex/[rr]<br />
&#038; &#038; \vtx{1} \ar@/^2ex/[ll]} $      then the Brauer-Severi fibration<br />
$~X_A \rightarrow \mathbf{iss}_{\alpha}~Q$ is flat everywhere except<br />
over the zero representation where the fiber is $~\mathbb{P}^1 \times<br />
\mathbb{P}^2$. On the other hand, for the order      $~B =<br />
\begin{bmatrix} C[x,y] &#038; C[x,y] \\ C[x,y] &#038; C[x,y] \end{bmatrix}$<br />
the Brauer-Severi fibration is flat and $~X_B \simeq \mathbb{A}^2 \times<br />
\mathbb{P}^1$. It turns out that $~X_A$ is a blow-up of $~X_B$ at a<br />
point in the fiber over the zero-representation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>![][1]<br />
Classical Brauer-Severi varieties can be described either as twisted<br />
forms of projective space (Severi\&#8217;s way) or as varieties containing<br />
splitting information about central simple algebras (Brauer\&#8217;s way). If<br />
$K$ is a field with separable closure $\overline{K}$, the first approach<br />
asks for projective varieties $X$ defined over $K$ such that over the<br />
separable closure   $X(\overline{K}) \simeq<br />
\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{\overline{K}}$   they are just projective space. In<br />
the second approach let $\Sigma$ be a central simple $K$-algebra and<br />
define a variety $X_{\Sigma}$ whose points over a field extension $L$<br />
are precisely the left ideals of $\Sigma \otimes_K L$ of dimension $n$.<br />
This variety is defined over $K$ and is a closed subvariety of the<br />
Grassmannian $Gr(n,n^2)$. In the special case that $\Sigma = M_n(K)$ one<br />
can use the matrix-idempotents to show that the left ideals of dimension<br />
$n$ correspond to the points of $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_K$. As for any central<br />
simple $K$-algebra $\Sigma$ we have that $\Sigma \otimes_K \overline{K}<br />
\simeq M_n(\overline{K})$ it follows that the varieties $X_{\Sigma}$ are<br />
among those of the first approach. In fact, there is a natural bijection<br />
between those of the first approach (twisted forms) and of the second as<br />
both are classified by the Galois cohomology pointed set<br />
$H^1(Gal(\overline{K}/K),PGL_n(\overline{K}))$   because<br />
$PGL_n(\overline{K})$ is the automorphism group of<br />
$\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{\overline{K}}$ as well as of $M_n(\overline{K})$. The<br />
ringtheoretic relevance of the Brauer-Severi variety $X_{\Sigma}$ is<br />
that for any field extension $L$ it has $L$-rational points if and only<br />
if $L$ is a _splitting field_ for $\Sigma$, that is, $\Sigma \otimes_K L<br />
\simeq M_n(\Sigma)$. To give one concrete example, If $\Sigma$ is the<br />
quaternion-algebra $(a,b)_K$, then the Brauer-Severi variety is a conic<br />
 $X_{\Sigma} = \mathbb{V}(x_0^2-ax_1^2-bx_2^2) \subset \mathbb{P}^2_K$<br />
Whenever one has something working for central simple algebras, one can<br />
_sheafify_ the construction to Azumaya algebras. For if $A$ is an<br />
Azumaya algebra with center $R$ then for every maximal ideal<br />
$\mathfrak{m}$ of $R$, the quotient $A/\mathfrak{m}A$ is a central<br />
simple $R/\mathfrak{m}$-algebra. This was noted by the<br />
sheafification-guru [Alexander Grothendieck][2] and he extended the<br />
notion to Brauer-Severi schemes of Azumaya algebras which are projective<br />
bundles   $X_A \rightarrow \mathbf{max}~R$   all of which fibers are<br />
projective spaces (in case $R$ is an affine algebra over an<br />
algebraically closed field). But the real fun started when [Mike<br />
Artin][3] and [David Mumford][4] extended the construction to suitably<br />
_ramified_ algebras. In good cases one has that the Brauer-Severi<br />
fibration is flat with fibers over ramified points certain degenerations<br />
of projective space. For example in the case considered by Artin and<br />
Mumford of suitably ramified orders in quaternion algebras, the smooth<br />
conics over Azumaya points degenerate to a pair of lines over ramified<br />
points. A major application of their construction were examples of<br />
unirational non-rational varieties. To date still one of the nicest<br />
applications of non-commutative algebra to more mainstream mathematics.<br />
 The final step in generalizing Brauer-Severi fibrations to arbitrary<br />
orders was achieved by [Michel Van den Bergh][5] in 1986. Let $R$ be an<br />
affine algebra over an algebraically closed field (say of characteristic<br />
zero) $k$ and let $A$ be an $R$-order is a central simple algebra<br />
$\Sigma$ of dimension $n^2$. Let $\mathbf{trep}_n~A$ be teh affine variety<br />
of _trace preserving_ $n$-dimensional representations, then there is a<br />
natural action of $GL_n$ on this variety by basechange (conjugation).<br />
Moreover, $GL_n$ acts by left multiplication on column vectors $k^n$.<br />
One then considers the open subset in $\mathbf{trep}_n~A \times k^n$<br />
consisting of _Brauer-Stable representations_, that is those pairs<br />
$(\phi,v)$ such that $\phi(A).v = k^n$ on which $GL_n$ acts freely. The<br />
corresponding orbit space is then called the Brauer-Severio scheme $X_A$<br />
of $A$ and there is a fibration   $X_A \rightarrow \mathbf{max}~R$   again<br />
having as fibers projective spaces over Azumaya points but this time the<br />
fibration is allowed to be far from flat in general. Two months ago I<br />
outlined in Warwick an idea to apply this Brauer-Severi scheme to get a<br />
hold on desingularizations of quiver quotient singularities. More on<br />
this next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clearly<br />
this cannot be correct for consider for $n \in \mathbb{N} $ the order  </p>
<p>$A_n = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbb{C}[x] &#038; \mathbb{C}[x] \\ (x^n) &#038;<br />
\mathbb{C}[x] \end{bmatrix} $  </p>
<p>For $m \not= n $ the orders $A_n $<br />
and $A_m $ have isomorphic Azumaya locus, but are not isomorphic as<br />
orders. Still, the statement in the heading is _morally_ what <a
href="http://www2.umt.edu/math/People/Vonessen.html">Nikolaus<br />
Vonessen</a> and <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~reichst/">Zinovy<br />
Reichstein</a> are proving in their paper <a
href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0407152">Polynomial identity<br />
rings as rings of functions</a>. So I better clarify what they do claim<br />
precisely.  </p>
<p>Let $A $ be a _Cayley-Hamilton order_, that is, a<br />
prime affine $\mathbb{C} $-algebra, finite as a module over its center<br />
and satisfying all trace relations holding in $M_n(\mathbb{C}) $. If $A $<br />
is generated by $m $ elements, then its _representation variety_<br />
$\mathbf{rep}_n~A $ has as points the m-tuples of $n \times n $ matrices
 </p>
<p>$(X_1,\ldots,X_m) \in M_n(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \ldots \oplus<br />
M_n(\mathbb{C}) $  </p>
<p>which satisfy all the defining relations of<br />
A. $\mathbf{rep}_n~A $ is an affine variety with a $GL_n $-action<br />
(induced by simultaneous conjugation in m-tuples of matrices) and has<br />
as a Zariski open subset the tuples $(X_1,\ldots,X_m) \in<br />
\mathbf{rep}_n~A $ having the property that they generate the whole<br />
matrix-algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C}) $. This open subset is called the<br />
<strong>Azumaya locus</strong> of A and denoted by $\mathbf{azu}_n~A $.
  </p>
<p>One can also define the _generic Azumaya locus_ as being the<br />
Zariski open subset of $M_n(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \ldots \oplus<br />
M_n(\mathbb{C}) $ consisting of those tuples which generate<br />
$M_n(\mathbb{C}) $ and call this subset $\mathbf{Azu}_n $. In fact, one<br />
can show that $\mathbf{Azu}_n $ is the Azumaya locus of a particular<br />
order namely the trace ring of m generic $n \times n $ matrices.  </p>
<p>What Nikolaus and Zinovy prove is that for an order A the Azumaya<br />
locus $\mathbf{azu}_n~A $ is an irreducible subvariety of<br />
$\mathbf{Azu}_n $ and that the embedding  </p>
<p>$\mathbf{azu}_n~A<br />
\subset \mathbf{Azu}_n $  </p>
<p>determines A itself! If you have<br />
worked a bit with orders this result is strange at first until you<br />
recognize it as being essentially a consequence of Bill Schelter&#39;s<br />
catenarity result for affine p.i.-algebras.  </p>
<p>On the positive<br />
side it shows that the study of orders is roughly equivalent to that of<br />
the study of irreducible $GL_n $-stable subvarieties of $\mathbf{Azu}_n $.<br />
On the negative side, it shows that the $GL_n $-structure of<br />
$\mathbf{Azu}_n $ is horribly complicated. For example, it is still<br />
unknown in general whether the quotient-variety (which is here also the<br />
orbit space) $\mathbf{Azu}_n / GL_n $ is a rational variety. </p>
