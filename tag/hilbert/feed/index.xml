										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kasmana.people.cofc.edu/MATHFICT/mfview.php?callnumber=mf685">&#8220;Pythagorean Crimes&#8221;</a> by Tefcros Michaelides is a murder mystery set at the beginning of the 20th century. It starts with Hilbert&#8217;s address at the 1900 ICM in Paris (in which he gives his list of problems, such as the 2nd, his program for a finitistic proof of the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic) and ends in the early 1930ties (perhaps you can by now already guess which theorem will play a crucial role in the plot?).</p>
<p>It depicts beautifully daily (or better, nightly) life in mathematical and artistic circles, especially in Paris between 1900 and 1906.</p>
<p>Bricard, Caratheodory, Dedekind, Dehn, De la Vallee-Poussin, Frege, Godel, Hadamard, Hamel, Hatzidakis, Hermite, Hilbert, Klein, Lindemann, Minkowski, Peano, Poincare, Reynaud, Russell and Whitehead all make a brief appearance, as do Appollinaire, Casagemas, Cezanne, Degas, Derain, Max Jacob, Jacobides, Lumiere, Matisse, Melies, Pallares, Picasso, Renoir, Salmon, Toulouse-Lautrec, Utrillo, Zola.</p>

<p>Both lists contain names I had never heard of. But the biggest surprise, to me, was to discover the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Princet">Maurice Princet</a>,  &#8220;le mathématicien du cubisme&#8221;.</p>
<p>Princet (1875-1973) was a mathematician who frequented the group around Pablo Picasso at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Bateau-Lavoir">Bateau-Lavoir</a> in Montmartre (at least until 1907 when his wife left him for the painter Derain).</p>
<p>Princet introduced the group to the works of Poincare and the concept of the 4-th dimension. He gave Picasso the book &#8220;Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions&#8221; by Jouffret, describing hyper-cubes and other polyhedra in 4 dimensions and ways to project them dowm to the 2 dimensions of the canvas.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>This book appears to have been influential in the genesis of Picasso&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon">Les Demoiselles d&#8217;Avignon</a> (the painting also appears, in an unfinished state, in &#8220;Pythagorean Crimes&#8221;).</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>Some other painters tried to capture movement with projections from the 4-th dimension. A nice example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_Descending_a_Staircase,_No._2">Nude descending a staircase</a> by Marcel Duchamp (mostly known for his urinoir&#8230;).</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>Maurice Princet loved to get the artists interested in the new views on space. Duchamp told Pierre Cabanne, &#8220;We weren&#8217;t mathematicians at all, but we really did believe in Princet&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether Duchamp liked Princet&#8217;s own attempts at painting. Here&#8217;s a cubistic work by Maurice Princet himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The footnote on page E. II.6 in Bourbaki&#8217;s 1970 edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Th%C3%83%C2%A9orie-ensembles-French-N-Bourbaki/dp/3540340343">&#8220;Theorie des ensembles&#8221;</a> reads<br />

If this is completely obvious to you, stop reading now and start getting a life. For the rest of us, it took me quite some time before i was able to parse this formula, and when i finally did, it only added to my initial confusion.</p>
<p>Though the Bourbakis had a very preliminary version of their set-theory already out in 1939 (Fascicule des Resultats), the version as we know it now was published, chapter-wise, in the fifties: Chapters I and II in 1954, Chapter III in 1956 and finally Chapter IV in 1957.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/hilbert.gif" align=right><br />
In the first chapter they develop their version of logic, using &#8216;assemblages&#8217; (assemblies) which are words of signs and letters, the signs being $\tau, \square, \vee, \neg, =, \in$ and $\supset$.</p>
<p>Of these, we have the familiar signs $\vee$ (or), $\neg$ (not), $=$ (equal to) and $\in$ (element of) and, three more exotic ones: $\tau$ (their symbol for the <a href="http://planetmath.org/HilbertsVarepsilonOperator">Hilbert operator</a> $\varepsilon$), $\square$ a sort of wildcard variable bound by an occurrence of $\tau$ (the &#8216;links&#8217; in the above scan) and $\supset$ for an ordered couple.</p>
<p>The connectives are written in front of the symbols they connect rather than between them, avoiding brackets, so far example $(x \in y) \vee (x=x)$ becomes $\vee \epsilon x y = x x$.</p>
<p>If $R$ is some assembly and $x$ a letter occurring in $R$, then the intende meaning of the *Hilbert-operator* $\tau_x(R)$ is &#8216;some $x$ for which $R$ is true if such a thing exists&#8217;. $\tau_x(R)$ is again an assembly constructed in three steps: (a) form the assembly $\tau R$, (b) link the starting $\tau$ to all occurrences of $x$ in $R$ and (c) replace those occurrences of $x$ by an occurrence of $\square$.</p>
<p>For MathJax reasons we will not try to draw links but rather give a linked $\tau$ and $\square$ the same subscript. So, for example, the claimed assembly for $\emptyset$ above reads</p>
<p>$\tau_y \neg \neg \neg \in \tau_x \neg \neg \in \square_x \square_y \square_y$</p>
<p>If $A$ and $B$ are assemblies and $x$ a letter occurring in $B$ then we denote by $(A | x)B$ the assembly obtained by replacing each occurrence of $x$ in $B$ by the assembly $A$. The upshot of this is that we can now write quantifiers as assemblies:</p>
<p>$(\exists x) R$ is the assembly $(\tau_x(R) | x)R$ and as $(\forall x) R$ is $\neg (\exists x) \neg R$ it becomes $\neg (\tau_x(\neg R) | x) \neg R$</p>
<p>Okay, let&#8217;s try to convert Bourbaki&#8217;s definition of the emptyset $\emptyset$ as &#8216;something that contains no element&#8217;, or formally $\tau_y((\forall x)(x \notin y))$, into an assembly.</p>
<p>&#8211; by definition of $\forall$ it becomes $\tau_y(\neg (\exists x)(\neg (x \notin y)))$<br />
&#8211; write $\neg ( x \notin y)$ as the assembly $R= \neg \neg \in x \square_y$<br />
&#8211; then by definition of $\exists$ we have to assemble $\tau_y \neg (\tau_x(R) | x) R$<br />
&#8211; by construction $\tau_x(R) = \tau_x \neg \neg \in \square_x \square_y$<br />
&#8211; using the description of $(A|x)B$ we finally indeed obtain $\tau_y \neg \neg \neg \in \tau_x \neg \neg \in \square_x \square_y \square_y$</p>
<p>But, can someone please explain what&#8217;s wrong with $\tau_y \neg \in \tau_x \in \square_x \square_y \square_y$ which is the assembly corresponding to $\tau_y(\neg (\exists x) (x \in y))$ which could equally well have been taken as defining the empty set and has a shorter assembly (length 8 and 3 links, compared to the one given of length 12 with 3 links).</p>
<p>Hair-splitting as this is, it will have dramatic implications when we will try to assemble Bourbaki&#8217;s definition of &#8220;1&#8221; another time.</p>
