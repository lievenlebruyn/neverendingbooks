										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, there was an interesting post by John Baez at the n-category cafe: <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2019/07/the_riemann_hypothesis_says_50.html">The Riemann Hypothesis Says 5040 is the Last</a>.</p>
<p>The 5040 in the title refers to the largest known counterexample to a bound for the sum-of-divisors function<br />
\[<br />
\sigma(n) = \sum_{d | n} d = n \sum_{d | n} \frac{1}{d} \]</p>
<p>In 1983, the french mathematician Guy Robin proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to<br />
\[<br />
\frac{\sigma(n)}{n~log(log(n))} < e^{\gamma} = 1.78107... \]
when $n > 5040$.</p>
<p>The other known counterexamples to this bound are the numbers 3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,16,18,20,24,30,36,48,60,72,84,120,180,240,360,720,840,2520.<br />

In Baez&#8217; post there is a nice graph of this function made by Nicolas Tessore, with 5040 indicated with a grey line towards the right and the other counterexamples jumping over the bound 1.78107&#8230;<br />

Robin&#8217;s theorem has a remarkable history, starting in 1915 with good old Ramanujan writing a part of this thesis on &#8220;highly composite numbers&#8221; (numbers divisible by high powers of primes).</p>
<p>His PhD. adviser Hardy liked his result but called them &#8220;in the backwaters of mathematics&#8221; and most of it was not published at the time of Ramanujan&#8217;s degree ceremony in 1916, due to paper shortage in WW1.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>When Ramanujan&#8217;s paper &#8220;Highly Composite Numbers&#8221; was first published in 1988 in &#8216;The lost notebook and other unpublished papers&#8217; it became clear that Ramanujan had already part of Robin&#8217;s theorem.</p>
<p>Ramanujan states that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, then for $n_0$ large enough we must have for all $n > n_0$ that<br />
\[<br />
\frac{\sigma(n)}{n~log(log(n))} < e^{\gamma} = 1.78107... \]

When Jean-Louis Nicolas, Robin's PhD. adviser, read Ramanujan's lost notes he noticed that there was a sign error in Ramanujan's formula which prevented him from seeing Robin's theorem.



<p />
<p>Nicolas: &#8220;Soon after discovering the hidden part, I read it and saw the difference between Ramanujan&#8217;s result and Robin&#8217;s one. Of course, I would have bet that the error was in Robin&#8217;s paper, but after recalculating it several times and asking Robin to check, it turned out that there was an error of sign in what Ramanujan had written.&#8221;</p>
<p />
<p>If you are interested in the full story, read the paper by Jean-Louis Nicolas and Jonathan Sondow: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6944">Ramanujan, Robin, Highly Composite Numbers, and the Riemann Hypothesis</a>.</p>
<p />
<p>What&#8217;s the latest on Robin&#8217;s inequality? An <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?query=Robin%27s+inequality&#038;searchtype=all&#038;abstracts=show&#038;order=-announced_date_first&#038;size=50">arXiv-search for Robin&#8217;s inequality</a> shows a flurry of activity.</p>
<p />
<p>For starters, it has been verified for all numbers smaller that $10^{10^{13}}$&#8230;</p>
<p />
<p>It has been verified, unconditionally, for certain classes of numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>all odd integers $> 9$</li>
<li>all numbers not divisible by a 25-th power of a prime</li>
</ul>
<p />
<p>Rings a bell? Here&#8217;s another hint:</p>
<p />
According to Xiaolong Wu in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00987">A better method than t-free for Robin&#8217;s hypothesis</a> one can replace the condition of &#8216;not divisible by an N-th power of a prime&#8217; by &#8216;not divisible by an N-th power of 2&#8217;.</p>
<p />
Further, he claims to have an (as yet unpublished) argument that Robin&#8217;s inequality holds for all numbers not divisible by $2^{42}$.</p>
<p />
So, where should we look for counterexamples to the Riemann hypothesis?</p>
<p />
What about the orders of huge simple groups?</p>
<p />
The order of the Monster group is too small to be a counterexample (yet, it is divisible by $2^{46}$).</p>
