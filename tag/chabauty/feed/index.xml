										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the few certainties we have on the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-wedding-invitation-that-nearly-killed-andre-weil">Bourbaki-Petard wedding invitation</a> is that it was printed in, and distributed out of Cambridge in the spring of 1939, presumably around mid April.</p>
<p>So, what was going on, mathematically, in and around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge">Trinity</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John%27s_College,_Cambridge">St. John&#8217;s College</a>, at that time?</p>
<p>Well, there was the birth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(University_of_Cambridge_magazine)">Eureka</a>, the journal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Archimedeans">the Archimedeans</a>, the mathematical society of the University of Cambridge. Eureka is one of the oldest recreational mathematics publications still in existence.</p>
<p />Since last year the back issues of Eureka are <a href="https://archim.org.uk/eureka/archive/">freely available online</a>, unfortunately missing out the very first two numbers from 1939.</p>
<p /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_P._Boas_Jr.">Ralph Boas</a>, one of the wedding-conspirators, was among the first to contribute to Eureka. In the second number, in may 1939, he wrote an article on &#8220;Undergraduate mathematics in America&#8221;.</p>
<p />And, in may 1940 (number 4 of Eureka) even the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/16-ways-to-capture-a-lion-in-1938">lion hunter H. Petard</a> wrote a short &#8216;Letter to the editors&#8217;.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/C1939b.jpg" width=100%><br />
</center></p>
<p>But, no doubt the hottest thing that spring in Cambridge were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/9780226904269/Wittgensteins-Lectures-Foundations-Mathematics-Cambridge-0226904261/plp">&#8216;Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics&#8217;</a>. Wittgenstein was just promoted to Professor after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Moore">G.E. Moore</a> resigned the chair in philosophy.</p>
<blockquote><p>For several terms at Cambridge in 1939, Ludwig Wittgenstein lectured on the philosophical foundations of mathematics. A lecture class taught by Wittgenstein, however, hardly resembled a lecture. He sat on a chair in the middle of the room, with some of the class sitting in chairs, some on the floor. He never used notes. He paused frequently, sometimes for several minutes, while he puzzled out a problem. He often asked his listeners questions and reacted to their replies. Many meetings were largely conversation.</p>
<p>These lectures were attended by, among others, D. A. T. Gasking, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._N._Findlay">J. N. Findlay</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Toulmin">Stephen Toulmin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Henrik_von_Wright">G. H. von Wright</a>, R. G. Bosanquet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Malcolm">Norman Malcolm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Rhees">Rush Rhees</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorick_Smythies">Yorick Smythies</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a clip from the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein_(film)">Wittgenstein</a>, directed by Derek Jarman.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xfdutZhUQIE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Missing from the list of people attending Wittgenstein&#8217;s lectures is Andre Weil, a Bourbaki member and the principal author of the wedding invitation.</p>
<p>Weil was in Cambridge in the spring of 1939 on a travel grant from the French research organisation for visits to the UK and Northern Europe. At that time, Weil held a position at the University of Strasbourg, uncomfortably close to Nazi-Germany.</p>
<p>Weil not attending Wittgenstein&#8217;s lectures is strange for several reasons. Weil was then correcting the galley proofs of Bourbaki&#8217;s first ever booklet, their own treatment of set theory, which appeared in 1939.</p>
<p>But also on a personal level, Andre Weil must have been intrigued by Wittgenstein&#8217;s philosophy, as it was close to that of his own sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a></p>
<blockquote><p>There are many parallels between the thinkers Simone Weil and Ludwig Wittgenstein. They each lived in a tense relationship with religion, with both being estranged from their cultural Jewish ancestry, and both being tempted at various times by the teachings of Catholicism.</p>
<p>They both underwent a profound and transformative mystical turn early into their careers. Both operated against the backdrop of escalating global conflict in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Both were concerned, amongst other things, with questions of culture, ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, science, and necessity. And, perhaps most notably, they both sought to radically embody their ideas and physically ‘live’ their philosophies.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Another reason why Weil might have been interested to hear Wittgenstein on the foundations of mathematics was a debate held in Paris of few months previously.</p>
<p>On February 4th 1939, the French Society of Philosophy invited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Lautman">Albert Lautman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cavaill%C3%A8s">Jean Cavaillès</a> &#8216;to define what constitutes the ‘life of mathematics’, between historical contingency and internal necessity, describe their respective projects, which attempt to think mathematics as an experimental science and as an ideal dialectics, and respond to interventions from some eminent mathematicians and philosophers.&#8217;</p>
<p>Among the mathematicians present and contributing to the discussion were Weil&#8217;s brothers in arms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ehresmann">Charles Ehresmann</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chabauty">Claude Chabauty</a>.</p>
<p>As Chabauty left soon afterwards to study with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_J._Mordell">Mordell</a> in Manchester, and visited Weil in Cambridge, Andre Weil must have known about this discussion.</p>
<p>The record of this February 4th meeting is available <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~emmanuel.ferrand/sensible/cavailles.pdf">here</a> (in French), and in English translation <a href="https://www.librarystack.org/urbanomic-documents-008-mathematical-thought-2/">from here</a>.</p>
<p>Jean Cavaillès took part in the French resistance, was arrested and shot by the Nazis on April 4th 1944. Albert Lautman was shot by the Nazis in Toulouse on 1 August 1944.</p>

</center></p>
<p>A book review of Wittgenstein&#8217;s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics by G. Kreisel is available from the <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183540380">Bulletin of the AMS</a>. Curiously, Kreisel compares Wittgenstein&#8217;s approach to &#8230; Bourbaki&#8217;s very own manifesto <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2305937?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">L&#8217;architecture des mathématiques</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons it is strange that Andre Weil apparently didn&#8217;t show much interest in Wittgenstein&#8217;s lectures.</p>
<p>Had he more urgent things on his mind, like prepping for a wedding?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last pre-war Bourbaki congress, held in september 1938 in Dieulefit, is surrounded by mystery. Compared to previous meetings, fewer documents are preserved in the <a href="http://portail.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/">Bourbaki archives</a> and some sentences in the surviving notules have been made illegible. We will have to determine the exact location of the Dieulefit-meeting before we can understand why this had to be done. It&#8217;s Bourbaki&#8217;s own tiny contribution to &#8216;le miracle de silence&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/Bourbaki1938.jpg" align=left style="margin-right:10px;"> First, the few facts we know about this Bourbaki congress, mostly from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/André_Weil">Andre Weil</a>&#8216;s autobiography <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Apprenticeship-Mathematician-Andre-Weil/dp/3764326506/">&#8216;The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician&#8217;</a>.</p>
<p>The meeting was held in <a href="http://www.drome-provence.com/villages/dieulefit.php">Dieulefit</a> in the Drome-Provencale region, sometime in september 1938 prior to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> (more on this next time). We know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Élie_Cartan">Elie Cartan</a> did accept Bourbaki&#8217;s invitation to join them and there is this one famous photograph of the meeting. From left to right : Simone Weil (accompanying Andre), Charles Pison, Andre Weil (hidden), Jean Dieudonne (sitting), Claude Chabauty, Charles Ehresmann, and Jean Delsarte.</p>
<p>Failing further written documentation, &#8216;all&#8217; we have to do in order to pinpoint the exact location of the meeting is to find a match between this photograph and some building in Dieulefit&#8230;</p>
<p>The crucial clue is provided by the couple of sentences, on the final page of the Bourbaki-archive document deldi_001 <a href="http://portail.mathdoc.fr/archives-bourbaki/PDF/deldi_001.pdf">Engagements de Dieulefit</a>, someone (Jean Delsarte?) has tried to make illegible (probably early on).</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/GeschrapteTekst.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>Blowing the picture up, it isn&#8217;t too hard to guess that the header should read &#8216;Décision du 22 septembre 1938&#8217; and that the first sentence is &#8216;Le Bourbaki de 2e classe WEIL fera pour le 15 octobre&#8217;. The document is signed</p>
<p>Camp de Beauvallon, le 22.IX.38.<br />
L&#8217;adjudant de jour<br />
DIEUDONNE</p>
<p>Now we are getting somewhere. Beauvallon is the name of an hamlet of Dieulefit, situated approximately 2.5km to the east of the center.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/Dieulefit.jpg"></p>
<p>Beauvallon is rather famous for its <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_de_Beauvallon">School</a>, founded in 1929 by <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Soubeyran">Marguerite Soubeyran</a> and <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Krafft">Catherine Krafft</a>, which was the first &#8216;modern&#8217; boarding school in France for both boys and girls having behavioral problems. From 1936 on the school&#8217;s director was <a href="http://www.lepost.fr/article/2008/09/03/1307302_simone-monnier-fondatrice-de-beauvallon.html">Simone Monnier</a>.</p>
<p>These three women were politically active and frequented several circles. Already in 1938 (at about the time of the Bourbaki congress) they knew the reality of the Nazi persecutions and planned to prepare their school to welcome, care for and protect refugees and Jewish children.</p>
<p>From 1936 on about 20 Spanish republican refugees found a home here and in the &#8216;pension&#8217; next to the school. When the war started, about 1500 people were hidden from the German occupation in Dieulefit (having a total population of 3500) : Jewish children, intellectuals, artists, trade union leaders, etc. etc. many in the Ecole and the Pension.</p>
<p>Because of the towns solidarity with the refugees, none were betrayed to the Germans, <a href="http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-societe/miracle-a-dieulefit/920/0/229069">Le miracle de silence à Dieulefit</a>.<br />
It earned the three Ecole-women the title of &#8220;Juste&#8221; after the war. More on this period can be read <a href="http://www.clio-cr.clionautes.org/spip.php?article2993">here</a>.</p>
<p>But what does this have to do with Bourbaki? Well, we claim that the venue of the 1938 Bourbaki congress was the <a href="http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-ecole-de-Beauvallon-263.html">Ecole de Beauvallon</a> and they probably used Le Pension for their lodgings.</p>
<p>We have photographic evidence comparing the Bourbaki picture with a picture taken in 1943 at the Ecole (the woman in the middle is Marguerite Soubeyran). Compare the distance between door and window, the division of the windows and the ivy on the wall.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/evidence1.jpg"></p>
<p>Below two photographs of the entire school building : on the left, the school with &#8216;Le Pension&#8217; next to it around 1938 (the ivy clad wall with the Bourbaki-door is to the right) and on the right, the present <a href="http://pagesperso-orange.fr/lesamisdebeauvallon/pages/0.html">Ecole de Beauvallon</a> (this site also contains a lot of historical material). The ivy has gone, but the main features of the building are still intact, only the shape of the small roof above the Bourbaki-door has changed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/evidence2.jpg"></p>
<p>During their stay, it is likely the Bourbakis became aware of the plans the school had would war break out. Probably, Jean Delsarte removed all explicit mention to the Ecole de Beauvallon from the archives upon their return. Bourbaki&#8217;s own small contribution to Dieulefit&#8217;s miracle of silence.</p>
