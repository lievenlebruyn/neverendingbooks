										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look around for mathematical theories of the structure of viruses, you quickly end up with the work of <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/reidun-twarock/">Raidun Twarock</a> and her group at the University of York.</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/gov-1-geometry-of-viruses">seen</a> her proposal to extend the Caspar-Klug classification of viruses. Her novel idea to distribute proteins on the viral capsid along Penrose-like tilings shouldn&#8217;t be taken too literally. The inherent aperiodic nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">Penrose tiles</a> doesn&#8217;t go together well with perfect tilings of the sphere.</p>
<p>Instead, the observation that these capsid tilings resemble somewhat Penrose tilings is a side-effect of another great idea of the York group. Recently, they borrowed techniques from the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal">quasicrystals</a> to gain insight in the inner structure of viruses, in particular on the interaction of the capsid with the genome.</p>
<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_restriction_theorem#:~:text=The%20crystallographic%20restriction%20theorem%20in,fold%2C%20and%206%2Dfold.&#038;text=Crystals%20are%20modeled%20as%20discrete,finite%20translations%20(Coxeter%201989).">crystallographic restriction theorem</a> no $3$-dimensional lattice can have icosahedral symmetry. But, we can construct aperiodic structures (quasicrystals) which have local icosahedral structure, much like Penrose tilings have local $D_5$-symmetry</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/PenroseTiling1.jpg" width=100% ></p>
<p>This is best explained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaas_Govert_de_Bruijn">de Bruijn</a>&#8216;s theory of pentagrids (more on that another time). Here I&#8217;ll just mention the representation-theoretic idea.</p>
<p>The isometry group of the standard $5$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^5$ is the group of all signed permutation $5 \times 5$ matrices $B_5$ (Young&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoctahedral_group">hyperoctahedral group</a>). There are two distinct conjugacy classes of subgroups in $B_5$ isomorphic to $D_5$, one such subgroup generated by the permutation matrices<br />
\[<br />
x= \begin{bmatrix}<br />
0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 \\<br />
1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{and} \qquad<br />
y = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \end{bmatrix}  \]<br />
The traces of $x,x^2$ and $y$, together with the <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/1/D5.html">character table of $D_5$</a> tell us that this $5$-dimensional $D_5$-representation splits as the direct sum of the trivial representation and of the two irreducible $2$-dimensional representations.<br />
\[<br />
\mathbb{R}^5 = A \simeq T \oplus W_1 \oplus W_2 \]<br />
with $T = \mathbb{R} d$, $W_1 = \mathbb{R} u_1 + \mathbb{R} u_2$ and $W_2 = \mathbb{R} w_1 + \mathbb{R} w_2$ where<br />
\[<br />
\begin{cases}<br />
(1,1,1,1,1)=d \\<br />
(1,c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4)= u_1 \\<br />
(0,s_1,s_2,s_3,s_4) = u_2 \\<br />
(1,c_2,c_4,c1,c3)= w_1 \\<br />
(0,s_2,s_4,s_1,s_3)= w_2<br />
\end{cases}<br />
\]<br />
and $c_j=cos(2\pi j/5)$ and $s_j=sin(2 \pi/5)$. We have a $D_5$-projection<br />
\[<br />
\pi : A \rightarrow W_1 \quad (y_0,\dots,y_4) \mapsto \sum_{i=0}^4 y_i(c_i u_1+s_i u_2) \]<br />
The projection maps the vertices of the $5$-dimensional hypercube to a planar configuration with $D_5$-symmetry.</p>

<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/5cube.jpg" width=50% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>de Bruijn&#8217;s results say that if we take suitable &#8216;windows&#8217; of lattice-points in $\mathbb{Z}^5$ and project them via the $D_5$-equivariant map $\pi$ onto the plane, then the images of these lattice points become the vertices of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling#Rhombus_tiling_(P3)">rhombic Penrose tiling</a> (and we get all such tilings by choosing our window carefully).</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Penrosetiling.jpg" width=80% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>This explains why Penrose tilings have a local $D_5$-symmetry. I&#8217;ll try to come back to de Bruijn&#8217;s papers in future posts.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s go back to viruses and the work of Twarock&#8217;s group using methods from quasicrystals. Such aperiodic structures with a local icosahedral symmetry can be constructed along similar lines. This time one starts with the standard $6$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z^6}$ with isometry group $B_6$ (signed $6 \times 6$ permutation matrices).</p>
<p>This group has three conjugacy classes of subgroups isomorphic to $A_5$, but for only one of them this $6$-dimensional representation decomposes as the direct sum of the two irreducible $3$-dimensional <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/1/A5.html">representations of $A_5$</a> (the decompositions in the two other cases contain an irreducible of dimension $4$ or $5$ together with trivial factor(s)). A representant of the crystallographic relevant case is given by the signed permutation matrices<br />
\[<br />
x= \begin{bmatrix}<br />
0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; -1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; -1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; -1 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; -1<br />
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \text{and} \qquad y=<br />
\begin{bmatrix}<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; -1 &#038; 0 \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; 1  \\<br />
0 &#038; 0 &#038; 0 &#038; -1 &#038; 0 &#038; 0<br />
\end{bmatrix} \]</p>
<p>Again, using suitable windows of $\mathbb{Z}^6$-lattice points and using the $A_5$-equivariant projection to one of the two $3$-dimensional components, one obtains quasicrystals with local $A_5$-symmetry.</p>
<p>In this $3$-dimensional case the replacements of the thick and thin rhombi are these four parallellepipeda, known as the Amman blocks<br />
<center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/AmmanTiles.jpg" width=60% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>which must be stacked together obeying the gluing condition that dots of the same colour must be adjacent.</p>
<p>Has anyone looked at a possible connection between the four Amman blocks (which come in pairs) and the four (paired) nucleotides in DNA? Just an idle thought&#8230;</p>
<p>These blocks grow into quasicrystals with local icosahedral symmetry.<br />
<center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/tiling3D2.jpg" width=80% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>The faces on the boundary of such a sphere-like quasicrystal then look a lot like a Penrose tiling.</p>
<p>How can we connect these group and representation-theoretic ideas to the structure of viruses? Here&#8217;s another thought-provoking proposal coming from the York group.</p>
<p>Take the $A_5$ subgroup of the hyperoctahedral group in six dimensiona $B_6$ generated by the above two matrices (giving a good $A_5$-equivariant projection $\pi$ to three dimensional space) and consider an intermediate group<br />
\[<br />
A_5 \subsetneq G \subseteq B_6 \]<br />
Take a point in $\mathbb{R}^6$ and look at its orbit under the isometries of $G$, then all these points have the same distance from the origin in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Now, project this orbit under $\pi$ to get a collection of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</p>
<p>As $\pi$ is only $A_5$-equivariant (and not $G$-equivariant) the image points may lie in different shells from the origin. We can try to relate these shells of points to observational data on the inner structures of viruses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty convincing instance of such a correlation, taken from the thesis by Emilio Zappa <a href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10124/1/Zappa%20PhD%20Thesis%20NEW.pdf">&#8220;New group theoretical methods for applications in virology and quasicrystals&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/hepatitis.jpg" width=80% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>This is the inner structure of the Hepatitis B virus, showing the envelope (purple), capsid protein (cream) and genome (light blue). The coloured dots are the image points in the different shells around the origin.</p>
<p>Do viruses invade us from the sixth dimension??</p>
