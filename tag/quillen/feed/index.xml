										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/who-dreamed-up-the-primesknots-analogy.html">Last time</a> we discovered  that the mental picture to view <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/what-is-the-knot-associated-to-a-prime.html">prime numbers as knots</a> in $S^3$ was first dreamed up by David Mumford. Today, we&#8217;ll focus on where and when this happened.</p>
<p><strong>3. When did Mazur write his unpublished preprint?</strong></p>
<p>According to his own <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/">website</a>, Barry Mazur did write the paper <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/papers/alexander_polynomial.pdf">Remarks on the Alexander polynomial</a> in 1963 or 1964. A quick look at the references gives us a coarse lower- and upper-estimate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/refMazur.jpg"></p>
<p>Apart from a paper by Iwasawa and one by Milnor, all references predate 1962 giving us a lower-bound. More interesting is reference (14) to David Mumford&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_invariant_theory">Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT)</a> which was first published in 1965 and is referred to as &#8216;in preparation&#8217;, so the paper was written no later than 1965. If we look a bit closer we see than some GIT-references are very precise</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/refGIT.jpg"></p>
<p>indicating that Mazur must have had the final version of GIT to consult, making it rather difficult to believe that the preprint was written late 1963 or early 1964.</p>
<p>Mazur&#8217;s dating of the preprint is probably based on this penciled note on the frontpage of the only surviving copy of the preprint</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/MazurDate.jpg"></p>
<p>It reads : &#8220;Date from about 63/64, H.R. Morton&#8221;. <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~su14/">Hugh Morton</a> of Liverpool University confirms that it is indeed his writing on the preprint.</p>
<p>Further, he told me that early 64 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Zeeman">Christopher Zeeman</a> held a Topology Symposium in Cambridge UK, where Hugh was a graduate student at the time and, as far as he could recall, Mazur attended that conference and gave him the preprint on that occasion, whence the 63/64 dating. Hugh kindly offered to double-check this with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._T._C._Wall">Terry Wall</a> who cannot remember Mazur attending that particular conference.</p>
<p>In fact, we will see that a more correct dating of the Mazur-preprint will be : late 1964 or early 1965.</p>
<p><strong>4. The birthday : July 10th 1964</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, Mumford&#8217;s insight predates the Mazur-preprint. In the first section, Mazur mentions &#8216;Grothendieck cohomology groups&#8217; rather than &#8216;Etale cohomology groups&#8217;.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/MazurPreprint.jpg"></p>
<p>At the time, Artin&#8217;s seminar notes on <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/~gor/Artin-GT.pdf">Grothendieck topologies</a> (spring 1962) were widely distributed, and Artin and Grothendieck were in the process of developing etale cohomology in their Paris 1963/64 seminar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Séminaire_de_Géométrie_Algébrique_du_Bois_Marie">SGA 4</a>, while Mumford was working on GIT in Harvard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/JLVerdier.jpg" align=left hspace=10> Mike Artin,  David Mumford and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Verdier">Jean-Louis Verdier</a> all attended the Woods Hole conference from july 6 till july 31 1964, famous for producing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atiyah–Bott_fixed-point_theorem">Atiyah-Bott fixed point theorem</a> (according to Fulton first proved by Verdier at the conference).</p>
<p>Etale cohomology was a hot topic at that conference. On july 10th there were three talks, Artin spoke on &#8216;Etale cohomology of schemes&#8217;, Verdier on &#8216;A duality theorem in the etale cohomology of schemes&#8217; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tate">John Tate</a> on &#8216;Etale cohomology over number fields&#8217;.</p>
<p>After a first week of talks, more informal seminars were organized, including the Atiyah-Bott seminar leading to the &#8216;Woods hole duality theorem&#8217; and one by Lubin-Tate and Serre on elliptic curves and formal groups. Two seminars adressed Etale Cohomology.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/semdualityWoodsHole.jpg"></p>
<p>Artin and Verdier ran a seminar on the etale cohomology of number fields leading to their duality result, and, three young turks : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quillen">Daniel Quillen</a>, <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/people/profile?pid=134">Steve Kleiman</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hartshorne">Robin Hartshorne</a> ran a Baby Seminar on Etale cohomology</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/sembabyWoodsHole.jpg"></p>
<p>Probably it is safe to say that the talks by Artin, Verdier and Tate on July 10th sparked the primes=knots idea, and if not then, a couple of days later.</p>
<p><strong>5. The birthplace : the Whitney Estate</strong></p>
<p>The &#8216;Woods Hole&#8217; conference took place at the Whitney Estate and all the lectures took place in the rustic rooms of the main building and the participants (and their families) were housed in rented cottages in the neighborhood, for the duration of the summer.</p>
<p>The only picture i managed to find from the Whitney house comes from a rather surprising source : <a href="http://www.woodsholemuseum.org/woodspages/sprtsl/v19n2-Garden.pdf">Gardeners and Caretakers ofWoods Hole</a>. Anyway, here it is :</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/mysteryhouse.jpg"></p>
<p>Probably, the knots=primes analogy was first dreamed up inside, or in the immediate neighborhood, on a walk to or from the cottages, overlooking the harbor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group">Monster</a> is the largest of the 26 sporadic simple groups and has order</p>
<p>808 017 424 794 512 875 886 459 904 961 710 757 005 754 368 000 000 000</p>
<p>= 2^46 3^20 5^9 7^6 11^2 13^3 17 19 23 29 31 41 47 59 71.</p>
<p>It is not so much the size of its order that makes it hard to do actual calculations in the monster, but rather the dimensions of its smallest non-trivial irreducible representations (196 883 for the smallest, 21 296 876 for the next one, and so on).</p>
<p>In characteristic two there is an irreducible representation of one dimension less (196 882) which appears to be of great use to obtain information. For example, Robert Wilson used it to prove that <a href="http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.A.Wilson/pubs/MHurwitz.ps">The Monster is a Hurwitz group</a>. This means that the Monster is generated by two elements g and h satisfying the relations</p>
<p>$g^2 = h^3 = (gh)^7 = 1 $</p>
<p>Geometrically, this implies that the Monster is the automorphism group of a Riemann surface of genus g satisfying the Hurwitz bound 84(g-1)=#Monster. That is,</p>
<p>g=9619255057077534236743570297163223297687552000000001=42151199 * 293998543 * 776222682603828537142813968452830193</p>
<p>Or, in analogy with the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-buckyball-curve.html">Klein quartic</a> which can be constructed from 24 heptagons in the tiling of the hyperbolic plane, there is a finite region of the hyperbolic plane, tiled with heptagons, from which we can construct this monster curve by gluing the boundary is a specific way so that we get a Riemann surface with exactly 9619255057077534236743570297163223297687552000000001 holes. This finite part of the hyperbolic tiling (consisting of #Monster/7 heptagons) we&#8217;ll call the <strong>empire of the monster</strong> and we&#8217;d love to describe it in more detail.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/whatdoesmonstersee.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>Look at the half-edges of all the heptagons in the empire (the picture above learns that every edge in cut in two by a blue geodesic). They are exactly #Monster such half-edges and they form a <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-best-rejected-proposal-ever.html">dessin d&#8217;enfant</a> for the monster-curve.</p>
<p>If we label these half-edges by the elements of the Monster, then multiplication by g in the monster interchanges the two half-edges making up a heptagonal edge in the empire and multiplication by h in the monster takes a half-edge to the one encountered first by going counter-clockwise in the vertex of the heptagonal tiling. Because g and h generated the Monster, the dessin of the empire is just a concrete realization of the monster.</p>
<p>Because g is of order two and h is of order three, the two permutations they determine on the dessin, gives a group epimorphism $C_2 \ast C_3 = PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \mathbb{M} $ from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_group">modular group</a> $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $ onto the Monster-group.</p>
<p>In noncommutative geometry, the group-algebra of the modular group $\mathbb{C} PSL_2 $ can be interpreted as the coordinate ring of a noncommutative manifold (because it is formally smooth in the sense of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9812158">Kontsevich-Rosenberg</a> or Cuntz-Quillen) and the group-algebra of the Monster $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} $ itself corresponds in this picture to a finite collection of &#8216;points&#8217; on the manifold. Using this geometric viewpoint we can now ask the question  <strong>What does the Monster see of the modular group?</strong></p>
<p>To make sense of this question, let us first consider the commutative equivalent : what does a point P see of a commutative variety X?</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/neighborhoods.jpg" ><br />
</center></p>
<p>Evaluation of polynomial functions in P gives us an algebra epimorphism $\mathbb{C}[X] \rightarrow \mathbb{C} $ from the coordinate ring of the variety $\mathbb{C}[X] $ onto $\mathbb{C} $ and the kernel of this map is the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_P $ of<br />
 $\mathbb{C}[X] $ consisting of all functions vanishing in P.</p>
<p>Equivalently, we can view the point $P= \mathbf{spec}~\mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{m}_P $ as the scheme corresponding to the quotient $\mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{m}_P $. Call this the 0-th formal neighborhood of the point P.</p>
<p>This sounds pretty useless, but let us now consider higher-order formal neighborhoods. Call the affine scheme $\mathbf{spec}~\mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{m}_P^{n+1} $ the n-th forml neighborhood of P, then the first neighborhood, that is with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{m}_P^2 $ gives us tangent-information. Alternatively, it gives the best linear approximation of functions near P.<br />
The second neighborhood $\mathbb{C}[X]/\mathfrak{m}_P^3 $ gives us the best quadratic approximation of function near P, etc. etc.</p>
<p>These successive quotients by powers of the maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}_P $ form a system of algebra epimorphisms</p>
<p>$\ldots \frac{\mathbb{C}[X]}{\mathfrak{m}_P^{n+1}} \rightarrow \frac{\mathbb{C}[X]}{\mathfrak{m}_P^{n}} \rightarrow \ldots \ldots \rightarrow \frac{\mathbb{C}[X]}{\mathfrak{m}_P^{2}} \rightarrow \frac{\mathbb{C}[X]}{\mathfrak{m}_P} = \mathbb{C} $</p>
<p>and its inverse limit $\underset{\leftarrow}{lim}~\frac{\mathbb{C}[X]}{\mathfrak{m}_P^{n}} = \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,P} $ is the completion of the local ring in P and contains all the infinitesimal information (to any order) of the variety X in a neighborhood of P. That is, this completion $\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,P} $ contains <strong>all information that P can see of the variety X</strong>.</p>
<p>In case P is a smooth point of X, then X is a manifold in a neighborhood of P and then this completion<br />
$\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,P} $ is isomorphic to the algebra of formal power series $\mathbb{C}[[ x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_d ]] $ where the $x_i $ form a local system of coordinates for the manifold X near P.</p>
<p>Right, after this lengthy recollection, back to our question <strong>what does the monster see of the modular group?</strong> Well, we have an algebra epimorphism</p>
<p>$\pi~:~\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} $</p>
<p>and in analogy with the commutative case, all information the Monster can gain from the modular group is contained in the $\mathfrak{m} $-adic completion</p>
<p>$\widehat{\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})}_{\mathfrak{m}} = \underset{\leftarrow}{lim}~\frac{\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})}{\mathfrak{m}^n} $</p>
<p>where $\mathfrak{m} $ is the kernel of the epimorphism $\pi $ sending the two free generators of the modular group $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) = C_2 \ast C_3 $ to the permutations g and h determined by the dessin of the pentagonal tiling of the Monster&#8217;s empire.</p>
<p>As it is a hopeless task to determine the Monster-empire explicitly, it seems even more hopeless to determine the kernel $\mathfrak{m} $ let alone the completed algebra&#8230; But, (surprise) we can compute $\widehat{\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})}_{\mathfrak{m}} $ as explicitly as in the commutative case we have $\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,P} \simeq \mathbb{C}[[ x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_d ]] $ for a point P on a manifold X.</p>
<p>Here the details : the quotient $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 $ has a natural structure of $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} $-bimodule. The group-algebra of the monster is a semi-simple algebra, that is, a direct sum of full matrix-algebras of sizes corresponding to the dimensions of the irreducible monster-representations. That is,</p>
<p>$\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} \simeq \mathbb{C} \oplus M_{196883}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus M_{21296876}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \ldots \ldots \oplus M_{258823477531055064045234375}(\mathbb{C}) $</p>
<p>with exactly 194 components (the number of irreducible Monster-representations). For any $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} $-bimodule $M $ one can form the tensor-algebra</p>
<p>$T_{\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M}}(M) = \mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} \oplus M \oplus (M \otimes_{\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M}} M) \oplus (M \otimes_{\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M}} M \otimes_{\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M}} M) \oplus \ldots \ldots $</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/cuntz.jpg"><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/Quillen.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>and applying the formal neighborhood theorem for formally smooth algebras (such as $\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $) due to <a href="http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/u/cuntz/cuntz.html">Joachim Cuntz</a> (left) and <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Quillen.html">Daniel Quillen</a> (right) we have an isomorphism of algebras</p>
<p>$\widehat{\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})}_{\mathfrak{m}} \simeq \widehat{T_{\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M}}(\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2)} $</p>
<p>where the right-hand side is the completion of the tensor-algebra (at the unique graded maximal ideal) of the $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} $-bimodule $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 $, so we&#8217;d better describe this bimodule explicitly.</p>
<p>Okay, so what&#8217;s a bimodule over a semisimple algebra of the form $S=M_{n_1}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \ldots \oplus M_{n_k}(\mathbb{C}) $? Well,  a <strong>simple</strong> S-bimodule must be either (1) a factor $M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C}) $ with all other factors acting trivially or (2) the full space of rectangular matrices $M_{n_i \times n_j}(\mathbb{C}) $ with the factor $M_{n_i}(\mathbb{C}) $ acting on the left, $M_{n_j}(\mathbb{C}) $ acting on the right and all other factors acting trivially.</p>
<p>That is, any S-bimodule can be represented by a quiver (that is a directed graph) on k vertices (the number of matrix components) with a loop in vertex i corresponding to each simple factor of type (1) and a directed arrow from i to j corresponding to every simple factor of type (2).</p>
<p>That is, for the Monster, the bimodule $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 $ is represented by a quiver on 194 vertices and now we only have to determine how many loops and arrows there are at or between vertices.</p>
<p>Using Morita equivalences and standard representation theory of quivers it isn&#8217;t exactly rocket science to determine that the number of arrows between the vertices corresponding to the irreducible Monster-representations $S_i $ and $S_j $ is equal to</p>
<p>$dim_{\mathbb{C}}~Ext^1_{\mathbb{C} PSL_2(\mathbb{Z})}(S_i,S_j)-\delta_{ij} $</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve been wasting a lot of time already here explaining what representations of the modular group have to do with quivers (see for example <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/why-nag-2.html">here</a> or some other posts in the same series) and for quiver-representations we all know how to compute Ext-dimensions in terms of the Euler-form applied to the dimension vectors.</p>
<p>Right, so for every Monster-irreducible $S_i $ we have to determine the corresponding dimension-vector $~(a_1,a_2;b_1,b_2,b_3) $ for the quiver</p>
<p>$\xymatrix{ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;<br />
\vtx{b_1} \\ \vtx{a_1} \ar[rrrru]^(.3){B_{11}} \ar[rrrrd]^(.3){B_{21}}<br />
\ar[rrrrddd]_(.2){B_{31}} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \vtx{b_2} \\ \vtx{a_2}<br />
\ar[rrrruuu]_(.7){B_{12}} \ar[rrrru]_(.7){B_{22}}<br />
\ar[rrrrd]_(.7){B_{23}} &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \vtx{b_3}} $</p>
<p>Now the dimensions $a_i $ are the dimensions of the +/-1 eigenspaces for the order 2 element g in the representation and the $b_i $ are the dimensions of the eigenspaces for the order 3 element h. So, we have to determine to which conjugacy classes g and h belong, and from Wilson&#8217;s paper mentioned above these are classes 2B and 3B in standard <a href="http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/spor/M/">Atlas notation</a>.</p>
<p>So, for each of the 194 irreducible Monster-representations we look up the character values at 2B and 3B (see below for the first batch of those) and these together with the dimensions determine the dimension vector $~(a_1,a_2;b_1,b_2,b_3) $.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/seemonsterchars.jpg"></p>
<p>For example take the 196883-dimensional irreducible. Its 2B-character is 275 and the 3B-character is 53. So we are looking for a dimension vector such that $a_1+a_2=196883, a_1-275=a_2 $ and $b_1+b_2+b_3=196883, b_1-53=b_2=b_3 $ giving us for that representation the dimension vector of the quiver above $~(98579,98304,65663,65610,65610) $.</p>
<p>Okay, so for each of the 194 irreducibles $S_i $ we have determined a dimension vector $~(a_1(i),a_2(i);b_1(i),b_2(i),b_3(i)) $, then standard quiver-representation theory asserts that the number of loops in the vertex corresponding to $S_i $ is equal to</p>
<p>$dim(S_i)^2 + 1 &#8211; a_1(i)^2-a_2(i)^2-b_1(i)^2-b_2(i)^2-b_3(i)^2 $</p>
<p>and that the number of arrows from vertex $S_i $ to vertex $S_j $ is equal to</p>
<p>$dim(S_i)dim(S_j) &#8211; a_1(i)a_1(j)-a_2(i)a_2(j)-b_1(i)b_1(j)-b_2(i)b_2(j)-b_3(i)b_3(j) $</p>
<p>This data then determines completely the $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{M} $-bimodule $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 $ and hence the structure of the completion $\widehat{\mathbb{C} PSL_2}_{\mathfrak{m}} $ containing all information the Monster can gain from the modular group.</p>
<p>But then, one doesn&#8217;t have to go for the full regular representation of the Monster. Any faithful permutation representation will do, so we might as well go for the one of minimal dimension.</p>
<p>That one is known to correspond to the largest maximal subgroup of the Monster which is known to be a two-fold extension $2.\mathbb{B} $ of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Monster_group">Baby-Monster</a>. The corresponding permutation representation is of dimension 97239461142009186000 and decomposes into Monster-irreducibles</p>
<p>$S_1 \oplus S_2 \oplus S_4 \oplus S_5 \oplus S_9 \oplus S_{14} \oplus S_{21} \oplus S_{34} \oplus S_{35} $</p>
<p>(in standard Atlas-ordering) and hence repeating the arguments above we get a quiver on just 9 vertices! The actual numbers of loops and arrows (I forgot to mention this, but the quivers obtained are actually symmetric) obtained were found after laborious computations mentioned in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/monstrous-frustrations.html">this post</a> and the details I&#8217;ll make avalable <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA/monsterquiver2.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who can spot a relation between the numbers obtained and any other part of mathematics will obtain quantities of genuine (ie. non-Inbev) Belgian beer&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you ever sat through a lecture by Alain Connes you will know about his insistence on the &#8216;canonical dynamic nature of noncommutative manifolds&#8217;. If you haven&#8217;t, he did write a blog post <a href="http://noncommutativegeometry.blogspot.com/2007/10/heart-bit-1.html">Heart bit 1</a> about it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
I&#8217;ll try to explain here that there is a definite &#8220;supplément d&#8217;âme&#8221; obtained in the transition from classical (commutative) spaces to the noncommutative ones. The main new feature is that &#8220;noncommutative spaces generate their own time&#8221; and moreover can undergo thermodynamical operations such as cooling, distillation etc&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here a section from his paper <a href="http://www.irem.uhp-nancy.fr/Lomb/maths.pdf">A view of mathematics</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>
Indeed even at the coarsest level of understanding of a space provided by measure<br />
theory, which in essence only cares about the “quantity of points” in a space, one<br />
ﬁnds unexpected completely new features in the noncommutative case. While it<br />
had been long known by operator algebraists that the theory of von-Neumann<br />
algebras represents a far reaching extension of measure theory, the main surprise<br />
which occurred at the beginning of the seventies is that such an algebra M<br />
inherits from its noncommutativity a <strong>god-given time evolution</strong>:</p>
<p>$\delta~:~\mathbb{R} \rightarrow Out(M) $</p>
<p>where $Out M = Aut M/Int M $ is the quotient of the group of automorphisms of M<br />
by the normal subgroup of inner automorphisms. This led in my thesis to the<br />
reduction from type III to type II and their automorphisms and eventually to the<br />
classiﬁcation of injective factors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even a commutative manifold has a kind of dynamics associated to it. Take a suitable vectorfield, consider the flow determined by it and there&#8217;s your &#8216;dynamics&#8217;, or a one-parameter group of automorphisms on the functions. Further, other classes of noncommutative algebras have similar features. For example, Cuntz and Quillen showed that also formally smooth algebras (the noncommutative manifolds in the algebraic world) have natural Yang-Mills flows associated to them, giving a one-parameter subgroup of automorphisms.</p>
<p>Let us try to keep far from mysticism and let us agree that by &#8216;time&#8217; (let alone &#8216;god given time&#8217;) we mean a one-parameter subgroup of algebra automorphisms of the noncommutative algebra. In nice cases, such as some von-Neumann algebras this canonical subgroup is canonical in the sense that it is unique upto inner automorphisms.</p>
<p>In the special case of the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/the-bost-connes-hecke-algebra.html">Bost-Connes algebra</a> these automorphisms $\sigma_t $ are given by $\sigma_t(X_n) = n^{it} X_n $ and $\sigma_t(Y_{\lambda}) = Y_{\lambda} $.</p>
<p>This one-parameter subgroup is crucial in the definition of the so called KMS-states (for Kubo-Martin and Schwinger) which is our next goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, Ed Segal gave a talk at the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/ARTS/">Arts</a>. His title &#8220;Superpotential algebras from 3-fold singularities&#8221; didnt look too promising to me. And sure enough it was all there again : stringtheory, D-branes, Calabi-Yaus, superpotentials, all the pseudo-physics babble that spreads virally among the youngest generation of algebraists and geometers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his talk did contain a general ringtheoretic gem. After a bit of polishing up this gem, contained in his paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702539">The A-infinity Deformation Theory of a Point and the Derived Categories of Local Calabi-Yaus</a>, can be stated as follows.</p>
<p>Let $A $ be a $\mathbb{C} $-algebra and let $M = S_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus S_k $ be a finite dimensional semi-simple representation with distinct simple components. Let $\mathfrak{m} $ be the kernel of the algebra epimorphism $A \rightarrow S $ to the semi-simple algebra $S=End(M) $. Then, the $\mathfrak{m} $-adic completion of $A $ is Morita-equivalent to the completion of a quiver-algebra with relations. The nice thing is that both the quiver and relations come in a canonical way from the $A_{\infty} $-structure on the Ext-algebra $Ext^{\bullet}_A(M,M) $. More precisely, there is an isomorphism</p>
<p>$\hat{A}_{\mathfrak{m}} \simeq \frac{\hat{T}_S(Ext^1_A(M,M)^{\ast})}{(Im(HMC)^{\ast})} $</p>
<p>where the homotopy Maurer-Cartan map comes from the $A_{\infty} $ structure maps</p>
<p>$HMC = \oplus_i m_i~:~T_S(Ext_A^1(M,M)) \rightarrow Ext^2_A(M,M) $</p>
<p>and hence the defining relations of the completion are given by the image of the dual of this map.</p>
<p>For ages, Ive known this result in the trivial case of formally smooth algebras (where $Ext^2_A(M,M)=0 $ and hence there are no relations to divide out) and where it is a consequence of a special case of the Cuntz-Quillen &#8220;tubular neighborhood&#8221; result. Completions of formally smooth algebras at semi-simples are Morita equivalent to completions of path algebras. This fact motivated all the local-quiver technology that was developed here in Antwerp over the last decade (see <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/?p=28">my book</a> if you want to know the details).</p>
<p>Also for 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau algebras it states that the completions at semi-simples are Morita equivalent to completions of quotients of path algebras by the relations coming from a superpotential (aka a necklace) by taking partial noncommutative derivatives. Here the essential ingredient is that $Ext^2_A(M,M)^{\ast} \simeq Ext^1_A(M,M) $ in this case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The<br />
problem with criticizing others is that you have to apply the same<br />
standards to your own work. So, as of this afternoon, I do agree with<br />
all those who said so before : my book is completely unreadable and<br />
should either be dumped or entirely rewritten!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened :<br />
 Last week I did receive the contract to publish _noncommutative<br />
geometry@n_ in a reputable series. One tiny point though, the editors<br />
felt that the title was somewhat awkward and would stand out with<br />
respect to the other books in the series, so they proposed as an<br />
alternative title _Noncommutative Geometry_. A tall order, I thought,<br />
but then, if others are publishing books with such a title why<br />
shouldn&#8217;t I do the same?</p>
<p>The later chapters are quite general, anyway,<br />
and if I would just spice them up a little adding recent material it<br />
might even improve the book. So, rewriting two chapters and perhaps<br />
adding another &#8220;motivational chapter&#8221; aimed at physicists&#8230; should<br />
be doable in a month, or two at the latest which would fit in nicely<br />
with the date the final manuscript is due.</p>
<p>This week, I got myself once<br />
again in writing mode : painfully drafting new sections at a pace of 5<br />
to 6 pages a day. Everything was going well. Today I wanted to finish<br />
the section on the &#8220;one quiver to rule them all&#8221;-trick and was<br />
already mentally planning the next section in which I would give details<br />
for groups like $PSL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $ and $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $, all I<br />
needed was to type in a version of the proof of the last proposition.</p>
<p>The proof uses  a standard argument, which clearly should be in the book<br />
so I had to give the correct reference and started browsing through the<br />
print-out of the latest version (about 600 pages long..) but&#8230; _I<br />
could not find it!???_ And, it was not just some minor technical lemma,<br />
but a result which is crucial to the book&#8217;s message (for the few who<br />
want to know, the result is the construction and properties of the local<br />
quiver at a semi-simple representation of a Quillen-smooth algebra). Of<br />
course, there is a much more general result contained in the book, but<br />
you have to be me (or have to be drilled by me) to see the connection&#8230;<br />
Not good at all!  I&#8217;d better sleep on this before taking further<br />
steps</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last time we have seen that the _coalgebra of distributions_ of an affine smooth variety is the direct sum (over all points) of the dual&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php?p=319">Last time</a> we<br />
have seen that the _coalgebra of distributions_ of an affine smooth<br />
variety is the direct sum (over all points) of the dual to the etale<br />
local algebras which are all of the form $\mathbb{C}[[<br />
x_1,\ldots,x_d ]] $ where $d $ is the dimension of the<br />
variety.  Generalizing this to _non-commutative_ manifolds, the first<br />
questions are : &#8220;What is the analogon of the power-series algebra?&#8221; and<br />
do all &#8216;points&#8217; of our non-commutative manifold do have such local<br />
algebras?  Surely, we no longer expect the variables to commute, so a<br />
non-commutative version of the power series algebra should be<br />
$\mathbb{C} \langle \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d \rangle \rangle $,<br />
the ring of formal power series in non-commuting variables. However,<br />
there is still another way to add non-commutativity and that is to go<br />
from an algebra to matrices over the algebra. So, in all we would expect<br />
to be our _local algebras_ at points of our non-commutative manifold to<br />
be isomorphic to  $M_n(\mathbb{C} \langle \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d<br />
\rangle \rangle) $  As to the second question : _qurves_ (that is,<br />
the coordinate rings of non-commutative manifolds) do have such algebras<br />
as local rings provided we take as the &#8216;points&#8217; of the non-commutative<br />
variety the set of all _simple_ finite dimensional representations of<br />
the qurve. This is a consequence of the _tubular neighborhood theorem_<br />
due to [Cuntz](http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/u/cuntz/cuntz.html) and<br />
[Quillen](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Quillen.html). In more details :  If A is a qurve, then a simple<br />
$n $-dimensional representation corresponds to an epimorphism<br />
$\pi~:~A \rightarrow S = M_n(\mathbb{C}) $ and if we take<br />
$\mathfrak{m}=Ker(\pi) $, then<br />
$M=\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 $ is an $S $-bimodule and<br />
the $\mathfrak{m} $-adic completion of A is isomorphic to the<br />
completed tensor-algebra   $\hat{T}_S(M) \simeq M_n(\mathbb{C}<br />
\langle \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d \rangle \rangle) $  In contrast with<br />
the commutative case however where the dimension remains constant over<br />
all points, here the numbers n and d can change from simple to simple.<br />
For n this is clear as it gives the dimension of the simple<br />
representation, but also d changes (it is the local dimension of the<br />
variety classifying simple representations of the same dimension). Here<br />
an easy example :  Consider the skew group algebra $A =<br />
\mathbb{C}[x] \star C_2 $ with the action given by sending $x<br />
\mapsto -x $. Then A is a qurve and its center is<br />
$\mathbb{C}[y] $ with $y=x^2 $. Over any point $y<br />
\not= 0 $ there is a unique simple 2-dimensional representation of A<br />
giving the local algebra $M_2(\mathbb{C}[[y]]) $. If<br />
$y=0 $ the situation is more complicated as the local structure<br />
of A is given by the algebra  $\begin{bmatrix} \mathbb{C}[[y]] &#038;<br />
\mathbb{C}[[y]] \\ (y) &#038; \mathbb{C}[[y]] \end{bmatrix} $  So, over<br />
this point there are precisely 2 one-dimensional simple representations<br />
corresponding to the maximal ideals  $\mathfrak{m}_1 =<br />
\begin{bmatrix} (y) &#038; \mathbb{C}[[y]] \\ (y) &#038; \mathbb{C}[[y]]<br />
\end{bmatrix}~\qquad \text{and}~\qquad \mathfrak{m}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}<br />
\mathbb{C}[[y]] &#038; \mathbb{C}[[y]] \\ (y) &#038; (y) \end{bmatrix} $  and<br />
both ideals are idempotent, that is $\mathfrak{m}_i^2 =<br />
\mathfrak{m}_i $ whence the corresponding bimodule $M_i =<br />
0 $ so the local algebra in either of these two points is just<br />
$\mathbb{C} $.  Ok, so the comleted local algebra at each point<br />
is of the form $M_n(\mathbb{C}\langle \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d \rangle<br />
\rangle) $, but what is the corresponding dual coalgebra. Well,<br />
$\mathbb{C} \langle \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d \rangle \rangle $ is<br />
the algebra dual to the _cofree coalgebra_ on $V = \mathbb{C} x_1 +<br />
\ldots + \mathbb{C}x_d $. As a vectorspace this is the<br />
tensor-algebra $T(V) = \mathbb{C} \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d<br />
\rangle $ with the coalgebra structure induced by the bialgebra<br />
structure defined by taking all varaibales to be primitives, that is<br />
$\Delta(x_i) = x_i \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes x_i $. That is, the<br />
coproduct on a monomial gives all different expressions $m_1 \otimes<br />
m_2 $ such that $m_1m_2 = m $. For example,<br />
$\Delta(x_1x_2) = x_1x_2 \otimes 1 + x_1 \otimes x_2 + 1 \otimes<br />
x_1x_2 $.  On the other hand, the dual coalgebra of<br />
$M_n(\mathbb{C}) $ is the _matrix coalgebra_ which is the<br />
$n^2 $-dimensional vectorspace $\mathbb{C}e_{11} + \ldots +<br />
\mathbb{C}e_{nn} $ with comultiplication  $\Delta(e_{ij}) =<br />
\sum_k e_{ik} \otimes e_{kj} $  The coalgebra corresponding to the<br />
local algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C}\langle \langle x_1,\ldots,x_d \rangle<br />
\rangle) $ is then the tensor-coalgebra of the matrix coalgebra and<br />
the cofree coalgebra.  Having obtained the coalgebra at each point<br />
(=simple representation) of our noncommutative manifold one might think<br />
that the _coalgebra of non-commutative distributions_ should be the<br />
direct sum of all this coalgebras, summed over all points, as in the<br />
commutative case. But then we would forget about a major difference<br />
between the commutative and the non-commutative world : distinct simples<br />
can have non-trivial extensions!  The mental picture one might have<br />
about simples having non-trivial extensions is that these points lie<br />
&#8216;infinitesimally close&#8217; together. In the $\mathbb{C}[x] \star<br />
C_2 $ example above, the two one-dimensional simples have<br />
non-trivial extensions so they should be thought of as a cluster of two<br />
infinitesimally close points corresponding to the point $y=0 $<br />
(that is, this commutative points splits into two non-commutative<br />
points). Btw. this is the reason why non-commutative algebras can be<br />
used to resolve commutative singularities (excessive tangents can be<br />
split over several non-commutative points).  While this is still pretty<br />
harmless when the algebra is finite over its center (as in the above<br />
example where only the two one-dimensionals have extensions), the<br />
situation becomes weird over general qurves as &#8216;usually&#8217; distinct<br />
simples have non-trivial extensions. For example, for the free algebra<br />
$\mathbb{C}\langle x,y \rangle $ this is true for all simples&#8230;<br />
So, if we want to continue using this image of points lying closely<br />
together this immediately means that non-commutative &#8216;affine&#8217; manifolds<br />
behave like compact ones (in fact, it turns out to be pretty difficult<br />
to &#8216;glue&#8217; together qurves into &#8216;bigger&#8217; non-commutative manifolds, apart<br />
from the quiver examples of [this old<br />
paper](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/9907136)).  So, how to bring<br />
this new information into our coalgebra of distributions? Well, let&#8217;s<br />
repeat the previous argument not with just one point but with a set of<br />
finitely many points. Then we have a _semi-simple algebra_ quotient<br />
$\pi~:~A \rightarrow S = M_{n_1}(\mathbb{C}) \oplus \ldots \oplus<br />
M_{n_k}(\mathb{C}) $  and taking again<br />
$\mathfrak{m}=Ker(\pi) $ and<br />
$M=\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 $, then $M $ is again an<br />
S-bimodule. Now, any S-bimodule can be encoded into a _quiver_  Q on k<br />
points, the number of arrows from vertex i to vertex j being the number<br />
of components in M of the form $M_{n_i \times<br />
n_j}(\mathbb{C}) $. Again, it follows from the tubular neighborhood<br />
theorem that the $\mathfrak{m} $-adic completion of A is<br />
isomorphic to the completion of an algebra Morita equivalent to the<br />
_path algebra_  $\mathbb{C} Q $ (being the tensor algebra<br />
$T_S(M) $).  As all the local algebras of the points are<br />
quotients of this quiver-like completion, on the coalgebra level our<br />
local coalgebras will be sub coalgebras of the coalgebra which is<br />
co-Morita equivalent (and believe it or not but coalgebraists have a<br />
name for this : _Takeuchi equivalence_) to the _quiver coalgebra_ which<br />
is the vectorspace of the path algebra $\mathbb{C} Q $ with<br />
multiplication induced by making all arrows from i to j skew-primitives,<br />
that is, $\Delta(a) = e_i \otimes a + a \otimes e_j $ where the<br />
$e_i $ are group-likes corresponding to the vertices.  If all of<br />
ths is a bit too much co to take in at once, I suggest the paper by Bill<br />
Chin [A brief introduction to coalgebra representation<br />
theory](http://condor.depaul.edu/~wchin/crt.pdf#search=%22%22A%20brief%20introduction%20to%20coalgebra%20representation%20theory%22%22).  The<br />
_coalgebra of noncommutative distributions_ we are after at is now the<br />
union of all these Takeuchi-equivalent quiver coalgebras. In easy<br />
examples such as the $\mathbb{C}[x] \star C_2 $-example this<br />
coalgebra is still pretty small (the sum of the local coalgebras<br />
corresponding to the local algebras $M_2(\mathbb{C}[[x]]) $<br />
summed over all points $y \not= 0 $ summed with the quiver<br />
coalgebra of the quiver  $\xymatrix{\vtx{} \ar@/^/[rr] &#038; &#038; \vtx{}<br />
\ar@/^/[ll]} $  In general though this is a huge object and we would<br />
like to have a recipe to construct it from a manageable _blue-print_ and<br />
that is what we will do next time. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this<br />
series of posts I&#8217;ll try to make at least part of the recent<br />
[Kontsevich-Soibelman paper](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0606241) a<br />
bit more accessible to algebraists.  In non-geometry, the algebras<br />
corresponding to *smooth affine varieties* I&#8217;ll call **qurves** (note<br />
that they are called **quasi-free algebras** by Cuntz &#038; Quillen and<br />
**formally smooth** by Kontsevich). By definition, a qurve in an affine<br />
$\mathbb{C} $-algebra A having the lifting property for algebra<br />
maps through nilpotent ideals (extending Grothendieck&#8217;s characterization<br />
of smooth affine algebras in the commutative case).  Examples of qurves<br />
are : finite dimensional semi-simple algebras (for example, group<br />
algebras $\mathbb{C} G $ of finite groups), coordinate rings of<br />
smooth affine curves  or a noncommutative mixture of both, skew-group<br />
algebras $\mathbb{C}[X] \ast G $ whenever G is a finite group of<br />
automorphisms of the affine curve X. These are Noetherian examples but<br />
in general a qurve is quite far from being Noetherian. More typical<br />
examples of qurves are : free algebras $\mathbb{C} \langle<br />
x_1,\ldots,x_k \rangle  $ and path algebras of finite quivers<br />
$~\mathbb{C} Q $. Recall that a finite quiver Q s just a<br />
directed graph and its path algebra is the vectorspace spanned by all<br />
directed paths in Q with multiplication induced by concatenation of<br />
paths.  Out of these building blocks one readily constructs more<br />
involved qurves via universal algebra operations such as (amalgamated)<br />
free products, universal localizations etc. In this way, the<br />
groupalgebra of the modular group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) $ (as well<br />
as that of a congruence subgroup) is a qurve and one can mix groups with<br />
finite groupactions on curves to get qurves like  $ (\mathbb{C}[X]<br />
\ast G) \ast_{\mathbb{C} H} \mathbb{C} M $  whenever H is a common<br />
subgroup of the finite groups G and M. So we have a huge class of<br />
qurve-examples obtained from mixing finite and arithmetic groups with<br />
curves and quivers. Qurves can we used as *machines* generating<br />
interesting $A_{\infty} $-categories.  Let us start by recalling<br />
some facts about finite closed subschemes of an affine smooth variety Y<br />
in the commutative case. Let **fdcom** be the category of all finite<br />
dimensional commutative $\mathbb{C} $-algebras with morphisms<br />
being onto algebra morphisms, then the study of finite closed subschemes<br />
of Y is essentially the study of the covariant functor  **fdcom** &#8211;><br />
**sets**  assigning to a f.d. commutative algebra S the set of all onto<br />
algebra maps from $\mathbb{C}[Y] $ to S. S being a f.d.<br />
commutative semilocal algebra is the direct sum of local factors  $S<br />
\simeq S_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus S_k $  where each factor has a<br />
unique maximal ideal (a unique point in Y). Hence, our study reduces to<br />
f.d. commutative images with support in a fixed point p of Y. But all<br />
such quotients are also quotients of the completion of the local ring of<br />
Y at p which (because Y is a smooth variety, say of dimension n) is<br />
isomorphic to formal power series<br />
$~\mathbb{C}[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]] $. So the local question, at any<br />
point p of Y,  reduces to finding all settings<br />
$\mathbb{C}[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]] \twoheadrightarrow S<br />
\twoheadrightarrow \mathbb{C} $  Now, we are going to do something<br />
strange (at least to an algebraist), we&#8217;re going to take duals and<br />
translate the above sequence into a coalgebra statement. Clearly, the<br />
dual $S^{\ast} $ of any finite dimensional commutative algebra<br />
is a finite dimensional cocommutative coalgebra. In particular<br />
$\mathbb{C}^{\ast} \simeq \mathbb{C} $ where the<br />
comultiplication makes 1 into a grouplike element, that is<br />
$\Delta(1) = 1 \otimes 1 $.  As long as the (co)algebra is<br />
finite dimensional this duality works as expected : onto maps correspond<br />
to inclusions, an ideal corresponds to a sub-coalgebra a sub-algebra<br />
corresponds to a co-ideal, so in particular a local commutative algebra<br />
corresponds to an pointed irreducible cocommutative coalgebra (a<br />
coalgebra is said to be irreducible if any two non-zero subcoalgebras<br />
have non-zero intersection, it is called simple if it has no non-zero<br />
proper subcoalgebras and is called pointed if all its simple<br />
subcoalgebras are one-dimensional.  But what about infinite dimensional<br />
algebras such as formal power series? Well, here the trick is not to<br />
take all dual functions but only those linear functions whose kernel<br />
contains a cofinite ideal (which brings us back to the good finite<br />
dimensional setting). If one takes only those good linear functionals,<br />
the &#8216;fancy&#8217;-dual $A^o $of an algebra A is indeed a coalgebra. On<br />
the other hand, the full-dual of a coalgebra is always an algebra. So,<br />
between commutative algebras and cocommutative coalgebras we have a<br />
duality by associating to an algebra its fancy-dual and to a coalgebra<br />
its full-dual (all this is explained in full detail in chapter VI of<br />
Moss Sweedler&#8217;s book &#8216;Hopf algebras&#8217;). So, we can dualize the above pair<br />
of onto maps to get coalgebra inclusions  $\mathbb{C} \subset<br />
S^{\ast} \subset U(\mathfrak{a}) $  where the rightmost coalgebra is<br />
the coalgebra structure on the enveloping algebra of the Abelian Lie<br />
algebra of dimension n (in which all Lie-elements are primitive, that is<br />
$\Delta(x) = x \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes x $ and indeed we have that<br />
$U(\mathfrak{a})^{\ast} \simeq \mathbb{C}[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]] $.<br />
We have translated our local problem to finding all f.d. subcoalgebras<br />
(containing the unique simple) of the enveloping algebra. But what is<br />
the point of this translation? Well, we are not interested in the local<br />
problem, but in the global problem, so we somehow have to **sum over all<br />
points**. Now, on the algebra level that is a problem because the sum of<br />
all local power series rings over all points is no longer an algebra,<br />
whereas the direct sum of all pointed irreducible coalgebras  $~B_Y<br />
= \oplus_{p \in Y} U(\mathfrak{a}_p)  $  is again a coalgebra! That<br />
is, we have found a huge coalgebra (which we call the coalgebra of<br />
&#8216;distributions&#8217; on Y) such that for every f.d. commutative algebra S we<br />
have  $Hom_{comm alg}(\mathbb{C}[Y],S) \simeq Hom_{cocomm<br />
coalg}(S^{\ast},B_Y) $  Can we get Y back from this coalgebra of<br />
districutions? Well, in a way, the points of Y correspond to the<br />
group-like elements, and if g is the group-like corresponding to a point<br />
p, we can recover the tangent-space at p back as the g-primitive<br />
elements of the coalgebra of distributions, that is the elements such<br />
that $\Delta(x) = x \otimes g + g \otimes x $. Observe that in<br />
this commutative case, there are no **skew-primitives**, that is<br />
elements such that $\Delta(x) = x \otimes g + h \otimes x $ for<br />
different group-likes g and h. This is the coalgebra translation of the<br />
fact that a f.d. semilocal commutative algebra is the direct sum of<br />
local components.  This is something that will definitely change if we<br />
try to extend the above to the case of qurves (to be continued).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now that my non-geometry post is linked via the comments in this string-coffee-table post which in turn is available through a trackback from the Kontsevich-Soibelman&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now<br />
that my <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php?p=247">non-geometry<br />
post</a> is linked via the comments in <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000844.html#more">this<br />
string-coffee-table post</a> which in turn is available through a<br />
trackback from the <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0606241">Kontsevich-Soibelman<br />
paper</a> it is perhaps useful to add a few links. </p>
<p>The little<br />
I&#8217;ve learned from reading about Connes-style non-commutative geometry is<br />
this : if you have a situation where a discrete group is acting with a<br />
bad orbit-space (for example, $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ acting on the whole<br />
complex-plane, rather than just the upper half plane) you can associate<br />
to this a $C^*$-algebra and study invariants of it and interprete them<br />
as topological information about this bad orbit space. An intruiging<br />
example is the one I mentioned and where the additional noncommutative<br />
points (coming from the orbits on the real axis) seem to contain a lot<br />
of modular information as clarified by work of Manin&amp;Marcolli and<br />
Zagier. Probably the best introduction into <strong>Connes-style<br />
non-commutative geometry</strong> from this perspective are the <a href="http://www.math.fsu.edu/~marcolli/BookVanderbilt.pdf">Lecture on<br />
Arithmetic Noncommutative Geometry</a> by <a href="http://www.math.fsu.edu/~marcolli/">Matilde Marcolli</a>. To<br />
algebraists : this trick is very similar to looking at the<br />
<strong>skew-group algebra</strong> $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n] * G$ if<br />
you want to study the _orbifold_ for a finite group action on affine<br />
space. But as algebraist we have to stick to affine varieties and<br />
polynomials so we can only deal with the case of a finite group,<br />
analysts can be sloppier in their functions, so they can also do<br />
something when the group is infinite. </p>
<p>By the way, the<br />
skew-group algebra idea is also why <strong>non-commutative algebraic<br />
geometry</strong> enters string-theory via the link with orbifolds. The<br />
easiest (and best understood) example is that of Kleinian singularities.<br />
The best introduction to this idea is via the <a href="http://www.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtwc/dmvlecs.pdf">Representations<br />
of quivers, preprojective algebras  and deformations of quotient<br />
singularities</a> notes by <a href="http://www.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtwc/">Bill Crawley-Boevey</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Artin-style non-commutative geometry</strong> aka<br />
<strong>non-commutative projective geometry</strong> originated from the<br />
work of Artin-Tate-Van den Bergh (in the west) and Odeskii-Feigin (in<br />
the east) to understand Sklyanin algebras associated to elliptic curves<br />
and automorphisms via &#8216;geometric&#8217; objects such as point- (and<br />
fat-point-) modules, line-modules and the like. An excellent survey<br />
paper on low dimensional non-commutative projective geometry is <a href="http://www.ams.org/bull/2001-38-02/S0273-0979-01-00894-1/S0273-0979-01-00894-1.pdf">Non-commutative curves and surfaces</a> by Toby<br />
Stafford and <a href="http://alpha.uhasselt.be/Research/Algebra/Members/michel_id.html"><br />
Michel Van den Bergh</a>. The best introduction is the (also<br />
neverending&#8230;) book-project <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~smith/Research/nag.pdf">Non-<br />
commutative algebraic geometry</a> by <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~smith/">Paul Smith</a> who<br />
maintains a <a href="http://www.math.washington.edu/~smith/Research/research.html"><br />
noncommutative geometry and algebra resource page</a> page (which is<br />
also available from the header). </p>
<p><strong>Non-geometry</strong><br />
started with the seminal paper &#8216;Algebra extensions and<br />
nonsingularity&#8217;, J.  Amer. Math. Soc. 8 (1995), 251-289 by <a href="http://www.math.uni-muenster.de/u/cuntz/cuntz.html">Joachim<br />
Cuntz</a> and Daniel Quillen but which is not available online. An<br />
online introduction is <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/9812158">Noncommutative smooth<br />
spaces</a> by Kontsevich and Rosenberg. Surely, different people have<br />
different motivations to study non-geometry. I assume Cuntz got<br />
interested because inductive limits of separable algebras are quasi-free<br />
(aka formally smooth aka qurves). Kontsevich and Soibelman want to study<br />
morphisms and deformations of $A_{\infty}$-categories as they explain in<br />
their <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/9812158">recent<br />
paper</a>. My own motivation to be interested in non-geometry is the<br />
hope that in the next decades one will discover new exciting connections<br />
between finite groups, algebraic curves and arithmetic groups (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine">monstrous<br />
moonshine</a> being the first, and still not entirely understood,<br />
instance of this).  Part of the problem is that these three topics seem<br />
to be quite different, yet by taking group-algebras of finite or<br />
arithmetic groups and coordinate rings of affine smooth curves they all<br />
turn out to be quasi-free algebras, so perhaps non-geometry is the<br />
unifying theory behind these seemingly unrelated topics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s<br />
an appeal to the few people working in Cuntz-Quillen-Kontsevich-whoever<br />
noncommutative geometry (the one where smooth affine varieties<br />
correspond to quasi-free or formally smooth algebras) : let&#8217;s rename our<br />
topic and call it <strong>non-geometry</strong>. I didn&#8217;t come up with<br />
this term, I heard in from Maxim Kontsevich in a talk he gave a couple<br />
of years ago in Antwerp. There are some good reasons for this name<br />
change.</p>
<p>The term _non-commutative geometry_ is already taken by<br />
much more popular subjects such as _Connes-style noncommutative<br />
differential geometry_ and _Artin-style noncommutative algebraic<br />
geometry_. Renaming our topic we no longer have to include footnotes<br />
(such as the one in the recent <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0606241">Kontsevich-Soibelman<br />
paper</a>) :</p>
<blockquote><p>  We use &#8220;formal&#8221; non-commutative geometry<br />
in tensor categories, which is different from  the non-commutative<br />
geometry in the sense of Alain Connes.  </p></blockquote>
<p>or to make a<br />
distinction between _noncommutative geometry in the small_ (which is<br />
Artin-style) and _noncommutative geometry in the large_ (which in<br />
non-geometry) as in the <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.AG/0506603">Ginzburg notes</a>. </p>
<p>Besides, the stress in _non-commutative geometry_ (both in Connes-<br />
and Artin-style) in on _commutative_. Connes-style might also be called<br />
&#8216;K-theory of $C^*$-algebras&#8217; and they use the topological<br />
information of K-theoretic terms in the commutative case as guidance to<br />
speak about geometrical terms in the nocommutative case. Similarly,<br />
Artin-style might be called &#8216;graded homological algebra&#8217; and they<br />
use Serre&#8217;s homological interpretation of commutative geometry to define<br />
similar concepts for noncommutative algebras. Hence, non-commutative<br />
geometry is that sort of non-geometry which is almost<br />
commutative&#8230;</p>
<p>But the main point of naming our subject<br />
non-geometry is to remind us not to rely too heavily on our<br />
(commutative) geometric intuition. For example, we would expect a<br />
manifold to have a fixed dimension. One way to define the dimension is<br />
as the trancendence degree of the functionfield. However, from the work<br />
of Paul Cohn (I learned about it through Aidan Schofield) we know that<br />
quasi-free algebras usually do&#8217;nt have a specific function ring of<br />
fractions, rather they have infinitely many good candidates for it and<br />
these candidates may look pretty unrelated. So, at best we can define a<br />
_local dimension_ of a noncommutative manifold at a point, say given by<br />
a simple representation. It follows from the Cunz-Quillen tubular<br />
neighborhood result that the local ring in such a point is of the<br />
form</p>
<p>$M_n(\mathbb{C} \langle \langle z_1,\ldots,z_m \rangle<br />
\rangle) $</p>
<p>(this s a noncommutative version of the classical fact<br />
than the local ring in a point of a d-dimensional manifold is formal<br />
power series $\mathbb{C} [[ z_1,\ldots,z_d ]] $) but in non-geometry both<br />
m (the _local_ dimension) and n (the dimension of the simple<br />
representation) vary from point to point. Still, one can attach to the<br />
quasi-free algebra A a finite amount of data (in fact, a _finite_ quiver<br />
and dimension vector) containing enough information to compute the (n,m)<br />
couples for _all_ simple points (follows from the <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0304196">one quiver to rule them<br />
all paper</a> or see <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0406618">this</a> for more<br />
details). </p>
<p>In fact, one can even extend this to points<br />
corresponding to semi-simple representations in which case one has to<br />
replace the matrix-ring above by a ring Morita equivalent to the<br />
completion of the path algebra of a finite quiver, the _local quiver_ at<br />
the point (which can also be computer from the one-quiver of A. The<br />
local coalgebras of distributions at such points of<br />
Kontsevich&amp;Soibelman are just the dual coalgebras of these local<br />
algebras (in <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0606241">math.RA/0606241</a> they<br />
merely deal with the n=1 case but no doubt the general case will appear<br />
in the second part of their paper).</p>
<p>The case of the semi-simple<br />
point illustrates another major difference between commutative geometry<br />
and non-geometry, whereas commutative simples only have self-extensions<br />
(so the distribution coalgebra is just the direct sum of all the local<br />
distributions) noncommutative simples usually have plenty of<br />
non-isomorphic simples with which they have extensions, so to get at the<br />
global distribution coalgebra of A one cannot simply add the locals but<br />
have to embed them in more involved coalgebras.</p>
<p>The way to do it<br />
is somewhat concealed in <a href="http://www.math.ua.ac.be/~lebruyn/paper/lebruyn2002d.pdf">the<br />
third version of my neverending book</a> (the version that most people<br />
found incomprehensible). Here is the idea : construct a huge uncountable<br />
quiver by taking as its vertices the isomorphism classes of all simple<br />
A-representations and with as many arrows between the simple vertices S<br />
and T as the dimension of the ext-group between these simples (and<br />
again, these dimensions follow from the knowledge of the one-quiver of<br />
A). Then, the global coalgebra of distributions of A is the limit over<br />
all cotensor coalgebras corresponding to finite subquivers). Maybe I&#8217;ll<br />
revamp this old material in connection with the Kontsevich&amp;Soibelman<br />
paper(s) for the mini-course I&#8217;m supposed to give in september.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A couple of days ago Ars Mathematica had a post Cuntz on noncommutative topology pointing to a (new, for me) paper by Joachim Cuntz A&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago <a href="http://www.arsmathematica.net/">Ars Mathematica</a> had a post <a href="http://www.arsmathematica.net/archives/2006/01/26/noncommutative-geometry/">Cuntz on noncommutative topology</a> pointing to a (new, for me) <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200108/fea-cuntz.pdf">paper</a> by <a href="http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/u/cuntz/cuntz.html">Joachim Cuntz</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>
A couple of years ago, the Notices of the AMS featured an article on noncommutative geometry a la Connes: Quantum Spaces and Their Noncommutative Topology by Joachim Cuntz. The hallmark of this approach is the heavy reliance on K theory. The first few pages of the article are fairly elementary (and full of intriguing pictures), before the K theory takes over.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A few comments are in order. To begin, the paper is **not** really about noncommutative geometry a la Connes, but rather about noncommutative geometry a la Cuntz&#038;Quillen (based on quasi-free algebras) or, equivalently, a la Kontsevich (formally smooth algebras) or if I may be so bold a la moi (qurves).</p>
<p>About the **intruiging pictures** : it seems to be a recent trend in noncommutative geometry research papers to include meaningless pictures to lure the attention of the reader. But, unlike aberrations such as the recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche">pastiche</a> by Alain Connes and Mathilde Marcolli <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.QA/0601054">A Walk in the Noncommutative Garden</a>, Cuntz is honest about their true meaning</p>
<blockquote><p>
I am indebted to my sons, Nicolas and Michael,<br />
for the illustrations to the examples above. Since<br />
these pictures have no technical meaning, they<br />
are only meant to provide a kind of suggestive<br />
visualization of the corresponding quantum spaces.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As one of these pictures made it to the cover of the **Notices** an explanation was included by the cover-editor</p>
<blockquote><p>
About the Cover : </p>
<p>The image on this month&#8217;s cover arose from<br />
Joachim Cuntz&#8217;s effort to render into visible art<br />
his own internal vision of a noncommutative<br />
torus, an object otherwise quite abstract. His<br />
original idea was then implemented by his son<br />
Michael in a program written in Pascal.  More<br />
explicitly, he says that the construction started<br />

Many mathematicians carry around inside<br />
their heads mental images of the abstractions<br />
they work with, and manipulate these objects<br />
somehow in conformity with their mental imagery. They probably also make aesthetic judgements of the value of their work according to<br />
the visual qualities of the images. These presumably common phenomena remain a rarely<br />
explored domain in either art or psychology. </p>

<p>There can be no technical meaning to the pictures as in the Connes and Cuntz&amp;Quillen approach there is only a noncommutative algebra and _not_ an underlying geometric space, so there is no topology, let alone a noncommutative topology. Of course, I do understand why Cuntz&amp;others name it as such. They view the noncommutative algebra as the ring of functions on some virtual noncommutative space and they compute topological invariants (such as K-groups) of the algebras and interprete them as information about the noncommutative topology of these virtual and unspecified spaces.</p>
<p>Still, it is perfectly possible to associate to a qurve (aka quasi-free algebra or formally smooth algebra) a genuine noncommutative topological space. In this series of posts I&#8217;ll explain the little I know of the history of this topic, the thing I posted about it a couple of years ago, why I abandoned the project and the changes I made to it since and the applications I have in mind, both to new problems (such as the birational_classification of qurves) as well as classical problems (such as rationality problems for $PGL_n $ quotient spaces).</p>
<p>Although others have tried to define noncommutative topologies before, I learned about them from <a href="http://www.math.ua.ac.be/algebra/member.php?who=freddy.van.oystaeyen">Fred Van Oystaeyen</a>. Fred spend the better part of his career constructing structure sheaves associated to noncommutative algebras, mainly to prime Noetherian algebras (the algebras of preference for the majority of non-commutative algebraists). So, suppose you have an ordinary (meaning, the usual commutative definition) topological space X associated to this algebra R, he wants to define an algebra of sections on every open subset $X(\sigma) $ by taking a suitable localization of the algebra $Q_{\sigma}(R) $. This localization is taken with respect to a suitable filter of left ideals $\mathcal{L}(\sigma) $ of R and is defined to be the subalgebra of the classiocal quotient ring $Q(R) $ (which exists because $R$ is prime Noetherian in which case it is a simple Artinian algebra)</p>
<p>$Q_{\sigma}(R) = { q \in Q(R)~|~\exists L \in \mathcal{L}(\sigma)~:~L q \subset R } $</p>
<p>(so these localizations are generalizations of the usual Ore-type rings of fractions). But now we come to an essential point : if we want to glue this rings of sections together on an intersection $X(\sigma) \cap X(\tau) $ we want to do this by &#8216;localizing further&#8217;. However, there are two ways to do this, either considering $~Q_{\sigma}(Q_{\tau}(R)) $ or considering $Q_{\tau}(Q_{\sigma}(R)) $ and these two algebras are only the same if we impose fairly heavy restrictions on the filters (or on the algebra) such as being compatible.</p>
<p>As this gluing property is essential to get a sheaf of noncommutative algebras we seem to get stuck in the general (non compatible) case. Fred&#8217;s way out was to make a distinction between the intersection $X_{\sigma} \cap X_{\tau} $ (on which he put the former ring as its ring of sections) and the intersection $X_{\tau} \cap X_{\sigma} $ (on which he puts the latter one). So, the crucial new ingredient in a noncommutative topology is that the order of intersections of opens matter !!!</p>
<p>Of course, this is just the germ of an idea. He then went on to properly define what a noncommutative topology (and even more generally a noncommutative Grothendieck topology) should be by using this localization-example as guidance. I will not state the precise definition here (as I will have to change it slightly later on) but early version of it can be found in the Antwerp Ph.D. thesis by Luc Willaert (1995) and in Fred&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/082470424X/102-5714622-6578538?v=glance&amp;n=283155">Algebraic geometry for associative algebras</a>.</p>
<p>Although _qurves_ are decidedly non-Noetherian (apart from trivial cases), one can use Fred&#8217;s idea to associate a noncommutative topological space to a qurve as I will explain next time. The quick and impatient may already sneak at my old note <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/math.RA/0307138">a non-commutative topology on rep A</a> but please bear in mind that I changed my mind since on several issues&#8230;</p>
