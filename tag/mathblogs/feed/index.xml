										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/mathblogging.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="http://matrix.cmi.ua.ac.be/DATA3/mathblogging.jpg" alt="" title="mathblogging" width="255" height="128" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4747" /></a> <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/">Mathblogging.org</a> is a recent initiative and may well become the default starting place to check on the status of the mathematical blogosphere.</p>
</p>
<p>Handy, if you want to (re)populate your RSS-aggregator with interesting mathematical blogs, is their graphical presentation of (nearly) all math-blogs <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/bytype">ordered by type</a> : group blogs, individual researchers, teachers and educators, journalistic writers, communities, institutions and microblogging (twitter). Links to the last 7 posts are given so you can easily determine whether that particular blog is of interest to you.</p>
<p>The three people behind the project, <a href="http://www.felixbreuer.net/">Felix Breuer</a>, <a href="http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/wst/users/heymann/">Frederik von Heymann</a> and <a href="http://peter.krautzberger.info/">Peter Krautzberger</a>, welcome you to send them links to (micro)blogs they&#8217;ve missed. Surely, there must be a lot more mathematicians with a twitter-account than the few ones listed so far&#8230;</p>
<p>Even more convenient is their <a href="http://www.mathblogging.org/bydate">list of latest posts</a> from their collection, ordered by date. I&#8217;ve put that page in my Bookmarks Bar the moment I discovered it! It would be nice, if they could provide an RSS-feed of this list, so that people could place it in their sidebar, replacing old-fashioned and useless blogrolls. The site does provide two feeds, but they are completely useless as they click through to empty pages&#8230;</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of math-blogging, the results of the &#8216;What should we write about next?&#8217;-poll that ran <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/changes-ahead.html">the previous two days</a> on the entry page. Of all people visiting that page, 2.6% left suggestions.</p>
<p>The vast majority (67%) wants more posts on <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/tag/noncommutative">noncommutative geometry</a>. Most of you are craving for introductions (and motivation) accessible to undergraduates (as &#8216;it&#8217;s hard to find quality, updated information on this&#8217;). In particular, you want posts giving applications in mathematics (especially number theory), or explaining relationships between different approaches. One person knew exactly how I should go about to achieve the hoped-for accessibility : &#8220;As a rule, I&#8217;d take what you think would be just right for undergrads, and then trim it down a little more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others want rather specialized posts, such as on &#8216;connection and parallel transport in noncommutative geometry&#8217; or on &#8216;trees (per J-L. Loday, M. Aguiar, Connes/Kreimer renormalization (aka Butcher group)), or something completely other tree-related&#8217;.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some of you told me it was fine to write about &#8216;combinatorial games and cool nim stuff, finite simple groups, mathematical history, number theory, arithmetic geometry&#8217;, pushed me to go for &#8216;anything monstrous and moonshiney&#8217; (as if I would know the secrets of the &#8216;connection between the Mathieu group M24 and the elliptic genus of K3&#8217;&#8230;) or wrote that &#8216;various algebraic geometry related posts are always welcome: posts like <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/index.php/mumfords-treasure-map.html">Mumford&#8217;s treasure map</a>&#8216;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/?p=237">Tanya Khovanova</a> I learned yesterday of <a href="http://www.onlinedegree.net/50-best-blogs-for-math-majors/">the 50 best math blogs for math-majors list</a> by OnlineDegree.net. Tanya&#8217;s blog got in 2nd (congrats!) and most of the blogs I sort of follow made it to the list : <a href="http://ncategory.wordpress.com/">the n-category cafe</a> (5), <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">not even wrong</a> (6), <a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com/">Gowers</a> (12), <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/">Tao</a> (13), <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/">good math bad math</a> (14), <a href="http://rigtriv.wordpress.com/">rigorous trivialities</a> (18), <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/">the secret blogging seminar</a> (20), <a href="http://kea-monad.blogspot.com/">arcadian functor</a> (28) (btw. Kea&#8217;s new blog is now at <a href="http://pseudomonad.blogspot.com/">arcadian pseudofunctor</a>), etc., etc. . Sincere congrats to you all!</p>
<p>NeverEndingBooks didn&#8217;t make it to the list, and I can live with that. For reasons only relevant to myself, posting has slowed down over the last year and the most recent post dates back from february!</p>
<p>More puzzling to me was the fact that <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/fun/">F-un mathematics</a> got in place 26! OnlineDegree had this to say about F-un Math : &#8220;Any students studying math must bookmark this blog, which provides readers with a broad selection of undergraduate and graduate concerns, quotes, research, webcasts, and much, much more.&#8221; Well, personally I wouldn&#8217;t bother to bookmark this site as prospects for upcoming posts are virtually  inexistent&#8230;</p>
<p>As I am privy to both sites&#8217; admin-pages, let me explain my confusion by comparing their monthly hits. Here&#8217;s the full F-un history</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/historyFUN.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>After a flurry of activity in the fall of 2008, both posting and attendance rates dropped, and presently the site gets roughly 50 hits-a-day. Compare this to the (partial) NeB history</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/historyNeB.jpg"><br />
</center></p>
<p>The whopping 45000 visits in january 2008 were (i think) deserved at the time as there was then a new post almost every other day. On the other hand, the green bars to the right are a mystery to me. It appears one is rewarded for not posting at all&#8230;</p>
<p>The only explanation I can offer is that perhaps more and more people are recovering from the late 2008-depression and do again enjoy reading blog-posts. Google then helps blogs having a larger archive (500 NeB-posts compared to about 20 genuine Fun-posts) to attract  a larger audience, even though the blog is dormant.</p>
<p>But this still doesn&#8217;t explain why FunMath made it to the top 50-list and NeB did not. Perhaps the fault is entirely mine and a consequence of a bad choice of blog-title. &#8216;NeverEndingBooks&#8217; does not ring like a math-blog, does it?</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m not going to change the title into something more math-related. NeverEndingBooks will be around for some time (unless my hard-disk breaks down). On the other hand, I plan to start something entirely new and learn from the mistakes I made over the past 6 years. Regulars of this blog will have a pretty good idea of the intended launch date, not?</p>
<p>Until then, my online activity will be limited to  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lievenlb">tweets</a>.</p>
