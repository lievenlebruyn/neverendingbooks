										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Belyi-extender (or <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/dessinflateurs">dessinflateur</a>) is a rational function $q(t) = \frac{f(t)}{g(t)} \in \mathbb{Q}(t)$ that defines a map<br />
\[<br />
q : \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}} \]<br />
unramified outside $\{ 0,1,\infty \}$, and has the property that $q(\{ 0,1,\infty \}) \subseteq \{ 0,1,\infty \}$.</p>
<p>An example of such a Belyi-extender is the power map $q(t)=t^n$, which is totally ramified in $0$ and $\infty$ and we clearly have that $q(0)=0,~q(1)=1$ and $q(\infty)=\infty$.</p>
<p>The composition of two Belyi-extenders is again an extender, and we get a rather mysterious monoid $\mathcal{E}$ of all Belyi-extenders.</p>
<p>Very little seems to be known about this monoid. Its units form the symmetric group $S_3$ which is the automrphism group of $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}} &#8211; \{ 0,1,\infty \}$, and mapping an extender $q$ to its degree gives a monoid map $\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_+^{\times}$ to the multiplicative monoid of positive natural numbers.</p>
<p>If one relaxes the condition of $q(t) \in \mathbb{Q}(t)$ to being defined over its algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, then such maps/functions have been known for some time under the name of <strong>dynamical Belyi-functions</strong>, for example in Zvonkin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/zvonkin/Research/belyi.pdf">Belyi Functions: Examples, Properties, and Applications (section 6)</a>.</p>
<p>Here, one is interested in the complex dynamical system of iterations of $q$, that is, the limit-behaviour of the orbits<br />
\[<br />
\{ z,q(z),q^2(z),q^3(z),&#8230; \} \]<br />
for all complex numbers $z \in \mathbb{C}$.</p>
<p>In general, the 2-sphere $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}} = S^2$ has a finite number of open sets (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Fatou domains</a>) where the limit behaviour of the series is similar, and the union of these open sets is dense in $S^2$. The complement of the Fatou domains is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set">Julia set</a> of the function, of which we might expect a nice <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=julia+sets&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0ahUKEwj19vHml5nkAhXHZFAKHT8ND8sQ_AUIEigB&#038;biw=1150&#038;bih=522">fractal picture</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take again the power map $q(t)=t^n$. For a complex number $z$ lying outside the unit disc, the series $\{ z,z^n,z^{2n},&#8230; \}$ has limit point $\infty$ and for those lying inside the unit circle, this limit is $0$. So, here we have two Fatou domains (interior and exterior of the unit circle) and the Julia set of the power map is the (boring?) unit circle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are indeed dynamical Belyi-maps having a more pleasant looking Julia set, such as this one<br />

</center></p>
<p>But then, many dynamical Belyi-maps (and Belyi-extenders) are systems of an entirely different nature, they are <strong>completely chaotic</strong>, meaning that their Julia set is the whole $2$-sphere! Nowhere do we find an open region where points share the same limit behaviour&#8230; (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">butterfly effect</a>).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a nice sufficient condition for chaotic behaviour, due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Sullivan">Dennis Sullivan</a>, which is pretty easy to check for dynamical Belyi-maps.</p>
<p>A <strong>periodic point</strong> for $q(t)$ is a point $p \in S^2 = \mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}}$ such that $p = q^m(p)$ for some $m > 1$. A <strong>critical point</strong> is one such that either $q(p) = \infty$ or $q'(p)=0$.</p>
<p>Sullivan&#8217;s result is that $q(t)$ is completely chaotic when all its critical points $p$ become eventually periodic, that is some $q^k(p)$ is periodic, <strong>but</strong> $p$ itself is not periodic.</p>
<p>For a Belyi-map $q(t)$ the critical points are either comlex numbers mapping to $\infty$ or the inverse images of $0$ or $1$ (that is, the black or white dots in the dessin of $q(t)$) which are not leaf-vertices of the dessin.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do an example, already used by Sullivan himself:<br />
\[<br />
q(t) = (\frac{t-2}{t})^2 \]<br />
This is a Belyi-function, and in fact a Belyi-extender as it is defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and we have that $q(0)=\infty$, $q(1)=1$ and $q(\infty)=1$. The corresponding dessin is (inverse images of $\infty$ are marked with an $\ast$)</p>
<p><cemter><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Sullivan.png" width=75% ><br />
</center></p>
<p>The critical points $0$ and $2$ are not periodic, but they become eventually periodic:</p>
<p>\[<br />
2 \rightarrow^q 0 \rightarrow^q \infty \rightarrow^q 1 \rightarrow^q 1 \]<br />
and $1$ is periodic.</p>
<p>For a general Belyi-extender $q$, we have that the image under $q$ of any critical point is among $\{ 0,1,\infty \}$ and because we demand that $q(\{ 0,1,\infty \}) \subseteq \{ 0,1,\infty \}$, every critical point of $q$ eventually becomes periodic.</p>
<p>If we want to avoid the corresponding dynamical system to be completely chaotic, we have to ensure that one of the periodic points among $\{ 0,1,\infty \}$ (and there is at least one of those) must be critical.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the very special Belyi-extenders $q$ having the additional property that $q(0)=0$, $q(1)=1$ and $q(\infty)=\infty$, then all three of them are periodic.</p>
<p>So, the system is always completely chaotic <strong>unless</strong> the black dot at $0$ is not a leaf-vertex of the dessin, or the white dot at $1$ is not a leaf-vertex, or the degree of the region determined by the starred $\infty$ is at least two.</p>
<p>Going back to the mystery <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-mystery-manin-marcolli-monoid">Manin-Marcolli sub-monoid of $\mathcal{E}$</a>, it might explain why it is a good idea to restrict to very special Belyi-extenders having associated dessin a $2$-coloured tree, for then the periodic point $\infty$ is critical (the degree of the outside region is at least two), and therefore the conditions of Sullivan&#8217;s theorem are not satisfied.  So, these Belyi-extenders do not necessarily have to be completely chaotic. (tbc)</p>
