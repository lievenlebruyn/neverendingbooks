					<description><![CDATA[The Clique (Twenty Øne Piløts fanatic fanbase) is convinced that the nine Bishops of Dema were modelled after the Bourbaki-group. It is therefore of no&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twentyonepilots.fandom.com/wiki/Skeleton_Clique">The Clique</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty Øne Piløts</a> fanatic fanbase) is convinced that the nine Bishops of Dema were modelled after the Bourbaki-group.</p>
<p>It is therefore of no surprise to see a Photoshopped version circulating of this classic picture of some youthful Bourbaki-members (note Jean-Pierre Serre poster-boying for Elon Musk&#8217;s site),</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BourbakiHeads.png" width=100%></p>
<p>replacing some of them with much older photos of other members. Crucial seems to be that there are just nine of them.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/9Bourbakis.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether the Clique hijacked Bourbaki&#8217;s Wikipedia page, or whether they were inspired by its content to select those people, but if you look at that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Wikipedia page</a> you&#8217;ll see in the right hand column:</p>
<p><strong>Founders</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Henri Cartan</li>
<li>Claude Chevalley</li>
<li>Jean Coulomb</li>
<li>Jean Delsarte</li>
<li>Jean Dieudonné</li>
<li>Charles Ehresmann</li>
<li>René de Possel</li>
<li>André Weil</li>
</ul>
<p>Really? Come on.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that Charles Ehresmann was brought in to replace Jean Leray, and Jean Coulomb to replace Paul Dubreil. Surely, replacements can&#8217;t be founders, can they?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately it is not quite that simple. There&#8217;s this silly semantic discussion: from what moment on can you call someone a Bourbaki-member&#8230;</p>
<p>The collective name &#8216;Nicolas Bourbaki&#8217; was adopted only at the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/where-is-the-royal-poldavian-academy">Bourbaki-congress in Besse</a> in July 1935 (see also <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/the-bumpy-road-to-the-first-bourbaki-congress">this post</a>).</p>
<p>But, before the Besse-meeting there were ten &#8216;proto-Bourbaki&#8217; meetings, the first one on December 10th, 1934 in Cafe Capoulade. These meetings have been described masterly by Liliane Beaulieu in <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/4320353/karen-v-h-parshall-a-parisian-cafe-and-ten-proto-bourbaki-">A Parisian Cafe and Ten Proto-Bourbaki Meetings (1934-35)</a> (btw. if you know a direct link to the pdf, please drop it in the comments).</p>
<p>During these early meetings, the group called itself &#8216;The Committee for the Treatise on Analysis&#8217;, and <em>not yet</em> Bourbaki, whence the confusion.</p>
<p>Do we take the Capoulade-1934 meeting as the origin of the Bourbaki group (in which case the founding-members would be Cartan, Chevalley, De Possel, Delsarte, Dieudonne, and Weil), or was the Bourbaki-group founded at the Besse-congress in 1935 (when Cartan, Chevalley, Coulomb, De Possel, Dieudonne, Mandelbrojt, and Weil were present)?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary of which people were present at all meetings from December 1934 until the second Chancay-congress in September 1939, taken from <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-03434735v2/document">Gatien Ricotier ‘Projets collectifs et personnels autour de Bourbaki dans les années 1930 à 1950&#8242;</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/9Bourbakis2.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>07-1935 is the Besse-congress, 09-1936 is the &#8216;Escorial&#8217;-congress (or Chancay 1) and 09-1937 is the second Chancay-congress. The ten dates prior to July 1935 are the proto-Bourbaki meetings.</p>
<p>Even though Delsarte was not present at the Besse-1935 congress, and De Possel moved to Algiers and left Bourbaki in 1941, I assume most people would agree that the six people present at the first Capoulade-meeting (Cartan, Chevalley, De Possel, Delsarte, Dieudonne, and Weil) should certainly be counted among the Bourbaki founding members.</p>
<p>What about the others?</p>
<p>We can safely eliminate Dubreil: he was present at just one proto-Bourbaki meeting and left the group in April 1935.</p>
<p>Also Leray&#8217;s case is straightforward: he was even excluded from the Besse-meeting as he didn&#8217;t contribute much to the group, and later he vehemently opposed Bourbaki, as <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/dema2trench-and-repeat">we&#8217;ve seen</a>.</p>
<p>Coulomb&#8217;s role seems to restrict to securing a venue for the Besse-meeting as he was &#8216;physicien-adjoint&#8217; at the &#8216;Observatoire Physique du Globe du Puy-de-Dome&#8217;.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.archivesdepartementales.puy-de-dome.fr/img/thumbnails/497_688/ill_2_559fi2597bis_3.jpg?1508419869" width=50%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Because of this he could rarely attend the Julia-seminar or Bourbaki-meetings, and his interest in mathematical physics was a bit far from the themes pursued in the seminar or by Bourbaki. It seems he only contributed one small text, in the form of a letter. Due to his limited attendance, even after officially been asked to replace Dubreil, he can hardly be counted as a founding member.</p>
<p>This leaves Szolem Mandelbrojt and Charles Ehresmann.</p>
<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/top-photoshop-mysteries">We&#8217;ve already described</a> Mandelbrojt as the odd-man-out among the early Bourbakis. According to the Bourbaki archive he only contributed one text. On the other hand, he also played a role in organising the Besse-meeting and in providing financial support for Bourbaki. Because he was present already early on (from the second proto-Bourbaki meeting) until the Chancay-1937 meeting, some people will count him among the founding members.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn&#8217;t call Charles Ehresmann a Bourbaki founding member because he joined too late in the process (March 1936). Still, purists (those who argue that Bourbaki was founded at Besse) will say that at that meeting he was put forward to replace Jean Leray, and later contributed actively to Bourbaki&#8217;s meetings and work, and for that reason should be included among the founding members.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>How many Bourbaki founding members are there? Six (the Capoulade-gang), seven (+Mandelbrojt), eight (+Mandelbrojt and Ehresmann), or do you still think there were nine of them?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you&#8217;re writing a book, and for the duration of that project you keep a certain photo as your desktop-background. I guess we might assume that picture to be inspirational for your writing process.</p>
<p>If you PhotoShopped it to add specific elements, might we assume these extra bits to play a crucial role in your story?</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s turn to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> and the creation process of their album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, released on October 5, 2018</p>
<p>We know from <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerrjoseph/status/1030991703203897345?s=20">this tweet</a> (from August 19th, 2018) that Tyler Joseph&#8217;s desktop-background picture was a photoshopped version of the classic Bourbaki-1938 photo on the left below, given it Trench-yellow, and added a bearded man in the doorway (photo on the right)</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bourbaki_congress1938.png/440px-Bourbaki_congress1938.png" width=45%> <img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BeauvallonTop.png" width=45%><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BeavallonDesktop.png" width=45%><br />
</center></p>
<p>And we know from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4CLo1gpHyQ&#038;t=13s">this interview</a> (from September 5th, 2018) that, apart from the bearded man, he also replaced in the lower left corner the empty chair by a sitting person (lower photo).</p>
<p>The original photo features on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">the Wikipedia page on Nicolas Bourbaki</a>, and as Tyler Joseph has revealed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurryface">Blurryface</a>&#8216;s real name is Nicolas Bourbaki (for whatever reason), and that he appears in the lyrics of <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-morph-lyrics">Morph</a> on Trench, this may make some sense.</p>
<p>But, of the seven people in the picture only three were founding members of Bourbaki: Weil, Diedonne and Delsarte. Ehresmann entered later, replacing Jean Leray, and Pison and Chabauty were only guinea pigs at that moment (they later entered Bourbaki, Chabauty briefly and Pison until 1950), and finally, Simonne Weil never was a member.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another strange thing about the original picture. All of them, but Andre and Simone Weil, look straight into the camera, the Weil&#8217;s seem to be more focussed on something happening to the right.</p>
<p>Now, TØP has something with the number 9. There are nine circles on the cover of Blurryface (each representing one of a person&#8217;s insecurities, it seems), there are nine towers in the City of Dema, nine Bishops, etc.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Blurryface_by_Twenty_One_Pilots.png" width=50%><br />
</center></p>
<p>So, from their perspective it makes sense to Photoshop two extra people in, and looking at the original there are two obvious places to place them: in the empty doorway, and on the empty chair.</p>
<p>But, who are they, and what is their significance?</p>
<p><strong>1. The bearded man in the doorway</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dk7RfAKW0AAjQ_-?format=jpg&#038;name=large" width=100%></p>
<p>As far as I know, nobody knows who he is. From a Bourbaki point of view it can only be one person: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan">Elie Cartan</a>.</p>
<p>We know he was present at the 1938 Bourbaki Dieulefit/Beauvallon meeting, and that he was kind of a father figure to Bourbaki. Among older French mathematicians he was one of few (perhaps the only one) respected by all of Bourbaki.</p>
<p>But, bearded man is definitely <em>not</em> Elie Cartan&#8230;</p>
<p>If bearded man exists and has a Wikipedia page, the photo should be on that page. So, if you find him, please leave a comment.</p>
<p>Previous in this series <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-bishops-or-banditos">I made a conjecture about him</a>, but I&#8217;m not at all sure.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why, of all people, Szolem Mandelbrojt?</strong></p>
<p>We know from this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/m28f43/i_found_one_of_the_people_shopped_into_tylers/?utm_source=embedv2&#038;utm_medium=post_embed&#038;utm_content=post_title&#038;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Flievenlebruyn.github.io%2Fneverendingbooks%2Fbourbaki-bishops-or-banditos">Twentyonepilots subReddit post</a> that the man sitting on the previously empty chair in none other than Bourbaki founding member <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szolem_Mandelbrojt">Szolem Mandelbrojt</a>, shopped in from this other iconic early Bourbaki-photo from the 1937 Chancay-meeting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/chancay2.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>Let me tell you why this surprises me.</p>
<p>Szolem Mandelbrojt was atypical among the first Bourbaki-gang in many ways: he was the only one who didn&#8217;t graduate from the ENS, he was a bit older than the rest, he was the only one who was a full Professor (at Clermont-Ferrand) whereas the others were &#8216;maitre de conference&#8217;, he was the only one who didn&#8217;t contribute actively in the Julia seminar (the proto-Bourbaki seminar) nor much to the Bourbaki-congresses either for that matter, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Most of all, I don&#8217;t think he would feel particularly welcome at the 1938 congress. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Hadamard_retouched.jpg" width=50%> <img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/LebesgueH.gif" width=40%><br />
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a> (left), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue">Henri Lebesgue</a> (right))<br />
</center></p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199904/rev-varadarajan.pdf">Andre Weil&#8217;s autobiography</a> (page 120):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hadamard&#8217;s retirement left his position open. I thought myself not unworthy of succeeding him; my friends, especially Cartan and Delsarte, encouraged me to a candidate. It seemed to me that Lebesgue, who was the only mathematician left at the College de France, did not find my candidacy out of place. He even let me know that it was time to begin my &#8216;campaign visits&#8217;.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Bourbaki-campaign against a hierarchy of scientific prizes instituted by Jean Perrin (the so called &#8216;war of the medals&#8217;) interfered with his personal campaign. (Perhaps more important was that Mandelbrojt did his Ph.D. under Hadamard&#8230;)</p>
<p>Again from Weil&#8217;s autobiography (page 121):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Finally Lebesque put an end to my visits by telling me that he had decided on Mandelbrojt. It seemed to me that my friends were more disappointed than I at this outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the spring of 1938, Mandelbrojt succeeded Hadamard at the College de France.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s photographic evidence that Mandelbrojt was present at the 1935 Besse-congress and clearly at the 1937-Chancay meeting, but I don&#8217;t know that he was even present at Chancay-1936. (Edit May 2024: He was present in 1936)</p>
<p>The only picture I know of that meeting is the one below. Standing on bench: Chevalley&#8217;s nephews, seated Andre Weil and Chevalley&#8217;s mother; standing, left to right: Ninette Ehresmann, Rene de Possel, Claude Chavalley, Jacqueline Chavalley, Mirles, Jean Delsarte and Charles Ehresmann.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTxTqVeTTAmeRRbsgIM1T8Z02UpJYttzxzljqZr2sV9Wii1MT9KfyAPPxszaJIGvPqFT6c&#038;usqp=CAU" width=100%></p>
<p>Of all possible people, Szolem Mandelbrojt would be <em>the</em> miscast at the 1938-meeting. So, why did they shop him in?</p>
<p>&#8211; convenience: they had an empty chair in the original picture, another Bourbaki-photo with a guy sitting on such a chair, so why not shop him in?</p>
<p>&#8211; mistaken identity: in the subReddit post the sitting guy was mistakenly identified as Claude Chevalley. Now, there is a lot to say about wishing to add Chevalley to the original. He is by far the most likeable of all Bourbakis, so if these nine were ever supposed to be the nine Bishops of Dema, he most certainly would be Keons. But, Chevalley was already in the US at that time, and was advised by the French consul to remain there in view of the situation in Europe. As a result, Chevalley could not obtain a French professorship before the early 50ties.</p>
<p>&#8211; a deep hidden clue: remember all that nonsense about Josh Dun&#8217;s &#8216;alma mater&#8217; being that Ukrainian building where Nico and the niners was shot? Well, Szolem Mandelbrojt&#8217;s alma mater was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Kharkiv">University of Kharkiv</a> in Ukraine. See <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-dema">this post</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is it all about Simone Weil?</strong></p>
<p>If you super-impose the two photographs, pinning Mandelbrojt in both, the left border of the original 1938-picture is an almost perfect mirror for both appearances of Simone Weil. Can she be more important in all of this than we think?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s this band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> and they&#8217;ve woven a complicated story around some of their albums, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurryface">Blurryface</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_and_Icy">Scaled and Icy</a>.</p>
<p>Since Trench, an important component of that story is the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Bourbaki group</a>, so I&#8217;m just curious whether the few things I know about them can help to clarify parts in the TØP- storyline.</p>
<p>Pretty pointless, I know, as no artistic project will follow blindly historical facts. But hey, as long as I discover new things I&#8217;ll keep going.</p>
<p>The story&#8217;s about a City of Dema, ruled by nine Bishops installing a terror regime called Vialism, and a land outside the city walls, called Trench, to which citizens would like to escape.</p>
<p>Think of Dema as an extremely toxic environment from which you need to escape to a safe place, let&#8217;s call it Trench.</p>
<p>Sadly, too often survivors from abusive settings later on create their own toxic environment, abusive to others.</p>
<p>So, Dema-escapees to Trench should always be wary of the danger of creating a new Dema for others.</p>
<p>It is very hard to break these Dema2Trench cycles of violence. That&#8217;s probably why the map of the City of Dema is circular.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with these two photos not (yet) in the Dema-lore:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Julia/Julia_4.jpeg" width=40%> <img decoding="async" src="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Julia/Julia_5.jpeg" width=40%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Both pictures are of the French mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Julia">Gaston Julia</a>.</p>
<p>Julia graduated from the ENS in 1914, so was among the worst victims of <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-dema">the military regime Lavisse installed at the ENS</a>. He was mobilised but hadn&#8217;t yet completed his second year of military training. That was shortened to just 5 months, after which we has send as a second lieutenant to the war.</p>
<p>In January 1915 he was seriously wounded in his face, had to undergo a series of operations and for the rest of his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been.</p>
<p>He ran a weekly seminar from 1933 till 1939, the <a href="http://www.numdam.org/actas/SMJ/">Seminaire Julia</a>, to which the Bourbaki core members contributed a vast number of lectures.</p>
<p>Until 1937-38 (so just before the Dieulefit Bourbaki congress) the Bourbakis felt happy citizens of Julia&#8217;s Seminar/Dema. But then they discovered his political agenda and were expelled from it, or escaped from it depending on the version.</p>
<p><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Leray">Jean Leray</a> convinced Julia that it was a terrible mistake to let his seminar run by Bourbaki, and that things would go much better if he ran it. Julia expelled Bourbaki from the seminar, changed its name to &#8216; Cercle mathématique de l’École normale supérieure&#8217; and moved the venue from the IHP to the ENS. The attendants of this seminar were younger and less international that in the preceding years, hence more malleable to his political ideas.</p>
<p>Another reason for the break-up between Bourbaki and Julia was that they reproached him of attending in June 1937 the festivities of the bicentennial of the University of Gottingen, which were seen as pure propaganda for the Nazi-regime.</p>
<p>During WW2, Julia collaborated with the occupying Nazi-regime in that he tried to find French mathematicians to contribute to the Zentralblatt. After the war he was briefly suspended for this.</p>
<p>Much more on the Julia seminar and the break-up with Bourbaki can be read in the thesis by Gatien Ricotier <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-03434735v2/document">&#8216;Projets collectifs et personnels autour de Bourbaki dans les années 1930 à 1950&#8217;</a>, and Michele Audin&#8217;s book on the Julia Seminar.</p>
<p>Let us compare Julia&#8217;s photographs to these two in Dema-lore:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b154da52cc7d8aca1c62f1e525ae1730/tumblr_pbtn184LKJ1s58hjm_500.png" width=57%> <img decoding="async" src="https://preview.redd.it/gim7kpwkrjc81.png?width=587&#038;format=png&#038;auto=webp&#038;s=962490e50b2203eea31087acfd56813adedb14c2" width=38%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Is it a coincidence that Clancy in Trench has a scar on his nose? Is it a coincidence that the black paint on some of the Bishop&#8217;s faces looks a lot like Julia&#8217;s mask?</p>
<p>Can it be that victims of one Dema-era become Bishops in a next era?</p>
<p>This repetitiveness of Dema-environments also indicates the importance of Bishop Andre. Recall that all the Bishops&#8217; names (except for Nico) come from concatenations of word-parts in the lyrics of the songs on the Blurryface album.</p>
<p>ANDRE comes from &#8216;..AND REpeat&#8217; in Fairly local:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Tomorrow I&#8217;ll keep a beat<br />
And repeat yesterday&#8217;s dance
</p></blockquote>
<p>In view of this, let&#8217;s have another look at the two Bourbaki-related photographs that appeared in the run up to the Trench-album:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bourbaki_congress1938.png/440px-Bourbaki_congress1938.png" width=52%> <img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Weil.jpg" width=40%><br />
</center></p>
<p>On the left is the photo of the Dieulefit/Beauvallon 1938 meeting, which is on the Bourbaki Wikipedia page, and was on the <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-and-top-east-is-up">desktop of Tyler Joseph</a>.</p>
<p>On the right a photo of Andre Weil together with a girl, according to Wikipedia the picture dates from 1956. I&#8217;m pretty certain it was taken in the summer of 1957, and that the girl is Mireille Cartan, the second youngest daughter of Henri Cartan. Not that any of this matters, TØP-wise. A clipping of the girl was among the material originally posted at the dmaorg.info site.</p>
<p>In 1938, Andre Weil was a victim of <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-dema">Lavisse&#8217;s Dema</a>. His year was the last one getting a military training to become reserve officers in the French infantry/artillery (as were Cartan, Dieudonne and Delsarte).</p>
<p>When France would mobilise they were forced to return to Dema (military service) and lead their bataljons as second lieutenants into war. All of them, except for Weil, did this.<br />
Weil escaped to Trench (Finland), and was taken back to Dema, and imprisonment.</p>
<p>In 1957, Bourbaki dominated much of French mathematical life, and certainly its influence in Paris was suffocating for aspiring math-students. A good read on this is Jacques Roubaud&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-French-Literature-Jacques-Roubaud/dp/1564786838">Mathematique</a>.</p>
<p>Bourbaki has turned French mathematics (and beyond) into its own Dema, and Andre Weil certainly was one of the more important Bishops of it.</p>

<p>and with a bit of sleuthing it led to <a href="https://www.dmaorg.site/original/found/15398642_14/clancy.html">a page on the dmaorg.info site</a> containing:</p>

<li>the <a href="https://www.dmaorg.site/original/found/15398642_14/img/b5c55b910823/se__elf.jpg">blurred photo</a> on the left below:</li>

<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Se_elf.jpg" width=55%> <img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Weil.jpg" width=40%><br />
</center></p>
<p>This was immediately identified as part of the photo on the right, which is on the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">French Wikipedia page for Andre Weil</a>.</p>
<p>The photo is clipped in such a way one cannot be certain whether the child is a boy or girl, so a logical explanation is that this is supposed to be the nine year old Clancy, shielding his eyes from the violence (vialism) he just discovered in Dema.</p>
<p>The full picture suggests that Clancy&#8217;s struggles might mirror some in Andre Weil&#8217;s life.</p>
<p><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a> was born May 6th, 1906, so &#8216;in his ninth year&#8217; World War 1 breaks out in 1914.</p>
<p><a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-dema">Last time</a> we&#8217;ve seen that Bourbaki&#8217;s Dema = Ecole Normal Superieure in Paris during WW1, Vialism = militant patriotism sending ENS-graduates as trained reserve second lieutenants in the infantry to the trenches, and there getting killed &#8216;pour la patrie&#8217; and the glory of the ENS and its director <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Lavisse">Ernest Lavisse</a>, &#8220;L&#8217;instituteur national&#8221;.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a G-translation of his letter to the young French, published September 23rd 1914:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear children of France, You will be old one day, and, like the old, you will like to remember times past. There will come evenings when your little children, seeing you dreaming, will say to you: Tell us, grandfather. And you will tell. It will be a few episodes of the war, a long march, an alert, a bayonet assault, a cavalry charge, the feat of a battery of 75, the strewn enemy dead on the plain, or else, in the streets of a city, the serried ranks of corpses left standing for lack of room to fall; and then the death of comrades, the terrible losses of your company and your regiment, your wounds received in Belgium, in Champagne, on the banks of the Rhine, beyond the Rhine; but the joy of victories, the poles knocked down on too narrow frontiers, triumphal entries.</p>
<p>On those evenings, after the amazed children have gone to sleep, you will open a drawer where you will have collected precious objects, a bullet extracted from a wound, a piece of shell, a cloth where your blood will have turned pale, a cross of honour, I hope, or a military medal, at the very least a medal from the 1914 war, on the ribbon of which the silver clasps will bear the names of immortal battles. And whatever your life, happy or unhappy, you will be able to say: I lived great days such as the history of men had not yet seen. And you will be right to be proud of your youth, because you are sublime young people!</p>
<p>I have read your letters; I have spoken with the wounded. Through you, I know what heroism is. I had heard a lot about it, being a historian by profession, but now I see it, I touch it, and how beautiful your heroism is, embellished with grace and smiling in the French way! Young soldiers if you were given one chevron per battle, your march would not be enough to accommodate them, because at the end of the war you would count more chevrons than years;</p>
<p>Young soldiers you are glorious old warriors.</p>
<p>Oh! Thanks thanks! Thank you for the beautiful end of life that you give to the elderly who, for forty-four years have suffered so much from the abasement of the fatherland.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The 44 years refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War">Franco-Prussian war of 1870</a> in which Bourbaki (the general) played a dramatic role.</p>
<p>The next cycle of militant patriotism occurred in the years leading up to the second world war. Here, Andre Weil&#8217;s experiences mirror those of Clancy. He tried several times to escape, first from military action (although he too was a reserve officer in the French army), then from France itself. He was captured in Finland, brought back to France to face trial and imprisonment, was released on the condition that he did active military duty, escaped with the French army to England, there demobilised he refused to join de Gaulle&#8217;s troops, left England on a boat to Marseille, from where he escaped to the US.</p>
<p>All this, and much more, you can read in his autobiography <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-0348-8634-5">The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician</a>, especially Chapter VI, The War and I: A Comic Opera in Six Acts.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dIRQ8r3YL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>(for TØP-ers, note the Bishop-red cover&#8230;)</p>
<p>Comic or not, the book tries to &#8216;explain&#8217; his actions in those years, but failed to convince the French from offering him a professorship at a French university after the war.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be worth looking into a comparison between Weil&#8217;s autobiography and the collected <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-dmaorginfo-transcriptions-annotated">Clancy letters</a>.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s the best I can do to explain the use of that Weil photo by TØP. Surely they didn&#8217;t search any deeper as to where and when this picture was taken, or who the girl was next to Weil.</p>
<p>In case anyone might be interested, I&#8217;ll be happy to explain my own theory about this in another post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the full photograph ended up in the &#8216;Trench-bible&#8217;, given to the director of their clip-movies. The scenery is used at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOUBW8bkjQ4&#038;t=282s">Jumpsuit video</a> when &#8216;Clancy&#8217; takes out a jumpsuit from the burning car and walks away along a road very similar to that in the photo.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/WeilRoad.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>The boy/girl shielding his/her eyes for the violence, should have been used at about minute one into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcvblM8-_o&#038;t=55s">Outside video</a></p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/WeilShieldinEyes.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Now, there&#8217;s another Weil (or rather Bourbaki) photograph <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-bishops-or-banditos">we know did inspire Twenty One Pilots</a>, the classic picture at the Dieulefit/Beauvallon 1938 Bourbaki-congress</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Bourbaki_congress1938.png/440px-Bourbaki_congress1938.png" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>which was photoshopped in order to get Szolem Mandelbrojt in from the Chancay (quite similar to Clancy now that i type this) 1937 Bourbaki congress</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/chancay2.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Now, these were the only two Bourbaki-meetings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a> (Andre&#8217;s sister) attended, and she features prominently in both pictures.</p>
<p>Probably this brother/sister thing struct a chord with Twenty One Pilots. But then, you quickly end up with this iconic picture of both of them, taken in the summer of 1922, just before Andre entered the Ecole Normale (he entered the ENS at age 16&#8230;)</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DU4BfakW4AE-JdO.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to be send a copy of the &#8216;Trench bible&#8217; because I&#8217;m fairly certain also this photograph is in it. At the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMAPyGoqQVw&#038;t=234s">Nico and the niners-video</a> you see this boy and girl (who may be around age 9 and discover the truth about Dema)  finding a jumpsuit with the Bishops approaching</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/SimoneAndreWeil.jpg" width=70%><br />
</center></p>
<p>and they reappear a bit older at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcvblM8-_o&#038;t=389s">Outside-video</a>, with a burning Dema in the background.</p>
<p><center><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this series I&#8217;m trying to figure out why the Bourbaki-group was an inspiration for the storyline of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, the fifth studio album by American musical duo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> (or TØP).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://topmasterdoc.carrd.co/assets/images/image21.jpg?v=c02a4a30" width=100% ></p>
<p>Trench-lore centers around the city of Dema, ruled by nine Bishops enforcing Vialism (a fake religion asking people to take their own lives to glorify Dema).</p>

<p>It is an unfortunate coincidence that the city of Dema in the movie-clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMAPyGoqQVw">Nico and the Niners</a> was inspired, and shot in Kyiv and Charkiv, Ukraine (the clip is from 2018).</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="500"><p>      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/9279qo/ive_just_found_out_that_dema_is_situated_in_my/">I&#8217;ve just found out that Dema is situated in my country&#8230; (NATN was made in Kyiv and Charkiv, Ukraine)</a><br /> by      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sasha0503">u/Sasha0503</a> in      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">twentyonepilots</a>    </p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s the corresponding &#8216;beyond the movie&#8217;-clip, from which we learn (or rather are told) that the movie&#8217;s &#8216;city of Dema&#8217; was shot in &#8216;the former Ukranian high-school&#8217; of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dun">Josh Dun</a> (he even calls it his &#8216;Alma Mater&#8217;), all in quotes because I don&#8217;t buy any of it, but take it as a desperate hint to identify Dema.</p>
<p>In the Trench movie-clips, Josh Dun is always cast as a Bandito, and last time we saw that also the Bourbaki-gang is likely to be close to the Banditos. Dema is supposed to be the Alma Mater of (at least some of) the Banditos. Hold that thought.</p>

<p>As for the connection between the City of Dema and the Bourbaki-group, we only have one piece of solid information:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/DemaBeforeBourbaki.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>That the Bourbaki-group named themselves after Nico=Nicolas Bourbaki clearly resonates with Twenty Øne Pilots who got their name from the 1947 play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Sons">&#8216;All My Sons&#8217;</a> by American playwright Arthur Miller.</p>
<p>But the crucial info is: &#8220;The story of Dema happened before them&#8221;, so the story of Dema with the Bishops and Vialism happened before the Bourbaki-group. An extra piece of evidence that there is no way the Bourbaki-group are the nine Bishops of Dema.</p>
<p>So, what happened before the Bourbaki-group?</p>
<p>Mathematically, their direct predecessors were David Hilbert, Emil Artin, Emmy Noether and her boys, in short German mathematicians from the 1920&#8217;s and early 1930&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Several of the Bourbaki founding members studied in Germany (Weil in Gottingen in 1927, Chevalley in Hamburg in 1931 and Marburg in 1932, and Ehresmann in Gottingen in 1930).</p>
<p>They were inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_program">Hilbert&#8217;s program</a> (<a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/we-must-know-we-will-know">We must know, we will know</a>), and set out to introduce the German style of writing and doing mathematics in France.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://mhedsson.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/group5869200031456766156.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>So, a first candidate (also given the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-bauhaus-architecture-4784133">Bauhaus-like architecture</a> of Dema) might be &#8216;German Mathematicians&#8217;, or in German, DEutscher MAthematiker = DEMA.</p>
<p>But one can hardly argue that there was a self-destructive attitude (like Vialism) present among that group, quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Still, one can ask why German mathematics was that strong in the 1920&#8217;s, compared to the French. France and Germany took different approaches with their intelligentsia during WW1: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French culture of egalitarianism.</p>
<p>Remember that the album is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, and the dirtiest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare">trench-war</a> in all of human history was WW1. Hold that thought.</p>
<p>But, how does this help us in identifying Dema.</p>
<p>A few months before the release of Trench, a website was launched containing letters (from a character named Clancy) and some photos (including part of a photo of Andre Weil). That website&#8217;s URL still is <a href="http://dmaorg.info/">dmaorg.info</a>.</p>
<p>On the rear of the boat in the movie-clip <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiXVRdotCEk">Saturday</a>, we see &#8216;030904 DMA ORG&#8217; (the 030904 is simplistic code for CID, believed to mean &#8216;Clancy Is Dead&#8217;).</p>

<p>Compare this to the official email address of the <a href="https://www.bourbaki.fr/">&#8216;Association des collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki&#8217;</a> which is: <strong>bourbaki@dma.ens.fr</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, &#8216;dma&#8217; stands for <a href="https://www.math.ens.psl.eu/en/welcome/">&#8216;Département de mathématiques et applications&#8217;</a>, one of the fifteen departments of the ENS, the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_(Paris)">Ecole Normal Superieure</a> in Paris, Rue d&#8217;Ulm.</p>

<p>All seven people in the original picture are &#8216;normaliens&#8217;, that is, their &#8216;Alma Mater&#8217; is the Ecole Normale Superieure&#8217;. All but Simone Weil graduated from the DEpartement de MAthematiques=DEMA, as DMA was called then.</p>
<p>Whence the hypothesis: <strong>Bourbaki&#8217;s Dema = ENS before and during WW1</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Cour_aux_Ernests_sous_la_neige.jpg/1280px-Cour_aux_Ernests_sous_la_neige.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>It is a conglomerate of buildings and its central courtyard forms a kind of secular cloister around its basin. This space is called &#8220;la Cour aux Ernests&#8221; in reference to a former director, Ernest Bersot. He had placed red (!) fish (=the Ernests in ENS-slang) in the basin, which have become one of the symbols of the school.</p>
<p>More important to us is that the pond of the Ernests is reached by crossing the &#8220;aquarium&#8221;, where the ENS war memorial is located, commemorating the 239 (former) ENS-students killed in WW1 on a tatal of about 1400 of them drafted&#8230;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--qFBZ0RWTo8/U4hVu8B-5AI/AAAAAAAAcf0/LfkMNvv6fXA/s1600/2+(Custom)+(Large).JPG" width=100%></p>
<p>From the Wikipedia-page on Nicolas Bourbaki:</p>
<p>&#8220;The deaths of ENS students resulted in a lost generation in the French mathematical community; the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (c. 1900–1918, especially 1910–1916) and populations considered.&#8221;</p>
<p>A chilling, and very detailed account of the circumstances that lead to the deaths of about 50% of ENS-student from the period 1910-1913 can be found in the paper <a href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-pole-sud-2012-1-page-9.htm">Pourquoi les normaliens sont-ils morts en masse en 1914-1918 ? Une explication structurale</a> (Why the normaliens suffered mass-death in 1914-18, a structural explanation) by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Mariot">Nicolas (!) Mariot</a>. Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<p>&#8220;The École Normale Supérieure d’Ulm is always mentioned when historians summarize the ravages of World War I in France: the institution embodies the commitment of intellectuals at the front. The article offers an interpretation of mortality rates of the School which allows to understand why it is primarily students during schooling (Classes 1910-1913) that are heavily affected. Rather than basing the interpretation on the single assumption of sacrifice, it puts forward arguments pertaining to the history of the school in the immediate pre-war, including the institution of military training after the reform service in 1905, competition with the École Polytechnique to retain the best scientific students, and finally the forced commitment of the ENS students in the infantry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crucial in this is the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Lavisse">Ernest Lavisse</a> who was the director of the ENS from 1903 till 1919.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Ernest_Lavisse%2C_1913.jpg/520px-Ernest_Lavisse%2C_1913.jpg" width=50%><br />
</center></p>
<p>Before, normaliens had to serve 12 months in the army, just like all other students. In 1905 the law changed, and under Lavisse&#8217;s influence ENS-students were given a heavy military training. From the paper:</p>
<p>&#8220;From now on, normalien students, like those of other major military schools, are subject to a two-year service: a first year before their actual entry into rue d&#8217;Ulm, which they had to perform in an infantry regiment; a second on leaving, which they can finish as a reserve second lieutenant, but always in the infantry, if they pass the tests. And there is more: because between these two years, the students also follow a fairly heavy military preparation, including theoretical and physical exercises, even on Sundays, organised by two officers seconded full-time for this mission within the walls of the School.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also instilled in the ENS-student a radical sense of patriotism, and was a fervent propagandist for <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_sacr%C3%A9e_(mouvement)">l&#8217;Union sacrée</a>. From the paper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Intellectual mobilisation crystallised in the figures of Lavisse and <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim">Durkheim</a> via their famous Letters to all French people distributed in millions of copies across the country. In the fall of 1914, the two founded and took control, respectively as director and secretary of the Committee for Studies and Documents on the War, a propaganda organ for the country&#8217;s executives.</p>
<p>Alongside them, eight of the nine other members of the Committee are former students of the School who have become professors at the Sorbonne (<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Andler">Charles Andler</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Seignobos">Charles Seignobos</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Boutroux">Émile Boutroux</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Denis">Ernest Denis</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Lanson">Gustave Lanson</a>) or at the Collège de France (<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B%C3%A9dier">Joseph Bédier</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Bergson">Henri Bergson</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a>), without even mentioning the role of editorial secretary held by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Herr">Lucien Herr</a>, legendary counterpart of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dupuy_(ENS)">Paul Dupuy</a> at the Rue d&#8217;Ulm library.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have liked that there were only nine members of the committee, but there were eleven of them&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, Lavisse and his eight professors created an extremely patriotic environment at the ENS during WW1, encouraging students to go to (the) Trench(es) and give their life for France and the glory of the Ecole. The ENS-monument is the equivalent of the Neon Gravestones in Dema-lore.</p>
<p>Did you spot it too? LAVIsse is almost a perfect anagram for VIALism.</p>
<p><a href="https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/se_non_%C3%A8_vero_%C3%A8_bene_trovato">Se non e vero&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Concluding, the best theory I can come up with in order to include the Bourbaki-group in Dema-lore is that their Dema is the ENS in WW1 and preceding years, and that Vialism is the regime installed by Lavisse and the other members from the committee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this series I&#8217;m trying to make sense of the inclusion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Nicolas Bourbaki</a> in the storyline of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, the fifth studio album by American musical duo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> (or TØP).</p>
<p>That story is about the walled city of Dema, ruled by nine bishops dressed in red cloaks. They enforce their religion, called Vialism, on the inhabitants of Dema. The end-goal in Vialism is that you take your own life, having maximal impact (think: suicide bombers).</p>
<p><center><br />

</center></p>
<p>Outside the walls of Dema is the land of Trench, where a group of fighters (the Banditos) set up camp. They are dressed in grey trenchcoats adorned with yellow ribbons, and their goal is to help people escape from Dema, via its east side.</p>
<p>What on earth has the Bourbaki group to do with any of this?</p>
<p>We know from a <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerrjoseph/status/1030991703203897345">tweet by Tyler Joseph</a> that one Bourbaki-photograph (or at least a PhotoShopped version of it) played an important role in the creative process, as he used it as the background image on his Mac while producing the album.</p>
<p>It can also be seen, blurred in the background, in the opening seconds of his interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music:</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4CLo1gpHyQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here are the three versions: the original photo, overlayed with the tweet-image, and a screenshot from the interview:</p>

<ul>

</ul>
<p>In the overlayed image an additional eight person, a bearded man, is PhotoShopped in the doorway, and in the screenshot we see that apart from this mystery man the empty chair in the lower left corner is replaced by a ninth person.</p>
<p>Common belief among the &#8216;clique&#8217; (TØP&#8217;s fanbase name) is that the nine people in the desktop image are the nine bishops of Dema, with the bearded man being Nico (the head-bishop), Andre Weil bishop Andre, and Simone Weil bishop Sacarver (the only known female bishop).</p>
<p>But who are these two additional persons?</p>
<p>In a remarkable tour de force, Reddit user &#8216;banditosleepers&#8217; was able to find the man sitting in the lower left corner (though he identified him wrongly)</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:316px" data-embed-height="316"><p>      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/m28f43/i_found_one_of_the_people_shopped_into_tylers/">I found one of the people shopped into Tyler&#8217;s desktop (2018)</a><br /> by      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/banditosleepers">u/banditosleepers</a> in      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">twentyonepilots</a>    </p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s this other famous pre-WW2 photo of a Bourbaki congress, this time the 1937 congress in <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/wheres-bourbakis-escorial">Chancay</a>:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/chancay2.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>Here we see, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andre Weil</li>
<li>Simone Weil (standing)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a> (Bourbaki founding member)</li>
<li><a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szolem_Mandelbrojt">Szolem Mandelbrojt</a> (Bourbaki founding member)</li>
<li><a href="">Claude Chevalley</a> (sitting on the bank, Bourbaki founding member)</li>
<li>Jean Delsarte (partially hidded)</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, the ninth person, sitting in the left lower corner of the screenshot is Szolem Mandelbrojt (and not Claude Chevalley, as claimed in the Reddit-post).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another photo, taken at about the same moment, showing that also Jean Dieudonne (sitting on the bank in front next to Andre Weil) and Charles Ehresmann (sitting on the bank on the right, next to Jean Delsarte and Claude Chevalley) were present.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/chancay1937photo2.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>Several people (myself included) have wasted too many hours trying to identify the bearded man in the doorway, starting from the assumption that he too might have some connection with Bourbaki (either the group or <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Denis_Bourbaki">the general</a>), without success.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one problem with the &#8216;bearded man = Nico&#8217; hypothesis. Nico is supposed to be the tallest of the bishops, and bearded man&#8217;s head is level with Andre Weil&#8217;s head, who stand on the first step, so bearded man must at least be 15cm smaller than Andre, who was already rather short.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a theory.</p>
<p>The original Dieulefit 1938 photo is the first one on the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki">Nicolas Bourbaki</a>, and if you click on it you get a link to one of my own blogposts <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-and-the-miracle-of-silence">Bourbaki and the miracle of silence</a>.</p>
<p>In that post (from 2010) I found the exact location where that photo was taken: the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_de_Beauvallon">Ecole de Beauvallon</a>, founded in 1929 by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Soubeyran">Marguerite Soubeyran</a> and Catherine Krafft, which was the first ‘modern’ boarding school in France for both boys and girls having behavioural problems. From 1936 on the school’s director was Simone Monnier.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA2/evidence1.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>The lower picture is taken at the Ecole de Beauvallon in 1943, the woman in the middle is Marguerite Soubeyran.</p>
<p>From 1936 on, about 20 refugees from the Spanish civil war found a home at the school, and in the ‘pension’, next to the school. When WW2 started, about 1500 people were hidden from the German occupation in Dieulefit (having a total population of 3500) : Jewish children, intellectuals, artists, trade union leaders, many in the Ecole and the Pension. None were betrayed to the Germans, and this is called <a href="https://www.slate.fr/story/98797/dieulefit-occupation">Le miracle de silence à Dieulefit</a>.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Given this historical context, there is only one possible way to include this Bourbaki-photo in the Trench-storyline: the Ecole de Beauvallon is the equivalent of the Bandito-camp, and the Bourbakis are Banditos (or at the very least, refugees having found a safe place in the camp).</p>
<p>In hindsight this was already given away by Tyler Joseph in that he gave the photo the color yellow, specifically Bandito-yellow 0xFCE300, which the bishops are unable to see (they see it as grey).</p>
<p>How does this help in identifying the bearded man in the doorway?</p>
<p>Standing in the doorway, he&#8217;s the one feeling at home there, gathering around him his guests or fellow fighters. My conjecture is that he is the leader of the bandito-camp, as seen at 2.12 in the movieclip of Levitate.</p>

<p>Granted, it is not a perfect match. I think &#8216;bearded man&#8217; is how Tyler Joseph envisioned the camp-leader, and included his picture in the &#8216;Trench Bible&#8217;, the 60 page booklet given to the movie-director, who did the casting some months later.</p>

<p>Next time we will try to find City of Dema, or at least what it should be if you take the inclusion of Bourbaki in the Trench storyline seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somehow I missed all the excitement, five years ago. From Bourbaki&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki#:~:text=Nicolas%20Bourbaki%20">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2018, the American musical duo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> released a concept album named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>. The album&#8217;s conceptual framework was the mythical city of &#8220;Dema&#8221; ruled by nine &#8220;bishops&#8221;; one of the bishops was named &#8220;Nico&#8221;, short for Nicolas Bourbaki. Another of the bishops was named Andre, which may refer to André Weil. Following the album&#8217;s release, there was a spike in internet searches for &#8220;Nicolas Bourbaki&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="500"><p>      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/comments/9uj0a2/google_trends_for_nicolas_bourbaki/">Google Trends for Nicolas Bourbaki</a><br /> by      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HiLlBiLlYjOeL_">u/HiLlBiLlYjOeL_</a> in      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">twentyonepilots</a>    </p></blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script></p>
<p>With summer and retirement coming up, I&#8217;m all in for <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/?s=bourbaki">another Bourbaki riddle</a>.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Joseph">Tyler Joseph</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Dun">Josh Dun</a> have weaved complicated storylines around the different albums of their band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a> (or TØP for short), each referring to a distinct era (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurryface">Blurryface</a>-era, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>-era, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_and_Icy">Scaled and Icy</a>-ra, etc.), each having a different color scheme, characters and so on.</p>
<p>You can easily get lost forever in their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twentyonepilots/">sub-Reddit</a>, or the numerous YouTube-clips and blogposts made by the &#8216;clique&#8217; (as their fanbase calls itself). Perhaps the quickest intro in the TØP-world is <a href="https://topmasterdoc.carrd.co/#homepage">this site</a>.</p>
<p>The Bourbaki-group is important to the Trench-era, yet there are very few direct references in the songs. There&#8217;s the song <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-morph-lyrics">&#8220;Morph&#8221;</a> (lol!) containing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
He&#8217;ll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki<br />
He&#8217;s got no friends close, but those who know him most know<br />
He goes by Nico<br />
He told me I&#8217;m a copy<br />
When I&#8217;d hear him mock me, that&#8217;s almost stopped me
</p></blockquote>
<p>So Nico=Nicolas Bourbaki, and there&#8217;s the song <a href="https://genius.com/Twenty-one-pilots-nico-and-the-niners-lyrics">&#8220;Nico and the niners&#8221;</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMAPyGoqQVw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>starting off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>
East is up<br />
I&#8217;m fearless when I hear this on the low<br />
East is up<br />
I&#8217;m careless when I wear my rebel clothes<br />
East is up<br />
When Bishops come together they will know that<br />
Dema don&#8217;t control us, Dema don&#8217;t control<br />
East is up
</p></blockquote>
<p>and that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll cover Dema and the Bishops in later posts, but for now remember the mantra &#8220;East is up&#8221;, which supposedly indicates the direction of escape from the Bishops and the city of Dema.</p>
<p>A few months before the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)">Trench</a>, a <a href="https://www.dmaorg.site/original/found/15398642_14/clancy.html">mysterious website</a> appeared, containing letters from someone called &#8216;Clancy&#8217; and some pictures and gifs. One of these pictures was soon found out to be part of an iconic photo of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil">Andre Weil</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/Se_elf.jpg" width=60%><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Weil.jpg" width=60%><br />
</center></p>
<p>This caught the attention of the &#8216;clique&#8217; because another picture indicated that the name of one of the Bishops was Andre.</p>
<p>Poor Andre was credited for just two things he managed to do : he founded a secret group of mathematicians, called Nicolas Bourbaki (important because another Bishop&#8217;s name was &#8216;Nico&#8217;) and he invented the symbol $\emptyset$ for the empty set (important because TØP used it since the Blurryface-era). I guess most mathematicians will remember Andre Weil for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weil_conjectures">other things</a>.</p>
<p>The clique-consensus seems to be that the girl next to Andre (some even thought it was a boy) is his daughter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvie_Weil">Sylvie Weil</a>.</p>
<p>If you ever read her novel <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Chez-Weil-Andr%C3%A9-Simone-Sylvie/dp/2283023696">Chez les Weil</a> you&#8217;ll remember that Sylvie did have from a very young age the same exuberant hairstyle as her aunt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil">Simone Weil</a>. So no, she&#8217;s definitely not Sylvie.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll save my theory as to where and when this photo was taken, who the girl next to Andre is, and how this picture was used later on in TØP-iconography, for another post.</p>
<p>For now, I just want to point out one tiny detail: the girl is shielding her eyes from the blistering summer-sun, and shadows are falling from right to left.</p>
<p>Got it? Yes: East is up!</p>
<p>The Bourbaki-hype intensified when Tyler Joseph tweeded on August 19th, indicating that a new Album called &#8216;Trench&#8217; was coming up:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">finally looking at mastered files.<br />album finished.<br />Trench<br />||-// <a href="https://t.co/xrN0cgbymd">pic.twitter.com/xrN0cgbymd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; tyler jøseph (@tylerrjoseph) <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerrjoseph/status/1030991703203897345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Again, there&#8217;s a lot more to say about this tweet, but for now look at the desktop-image. It&#8217;s part of one of the most known Bourbaki images of all time (also featuring on their Wikipedia page): the Dieulefit 1938-congress (which we discovered to be taken at <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/bourbaki-and-the-miracle-of-silence">Beauvallon</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/BeauvallonTop.png" width=100%></p>
<p>(Left to right: Simone Weil, C. Pisot, Andre Weil, Jean Dieudonne (seated), Claude Chabauty, Charles Ehresmann and Jean Delsarte)</p>
<p>Ah, you spotted it too? We&#8217;ll come back to this, and the clique made even more surprising discoveries wrt this picture.</p>
<p>You see, we&#8217;ll have a lot of ground to cover, so let&#8217;s stick to the &#8220;East is up&#8221; motto,for now.</p>
<p>Via Google maps you can check that the exit-door in the picture is located to the East side of the main building of the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_de_Beauvallon">Ecole de Beauvallon</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/beauvalloneast.png" width=100%></p>
<p>All Bourbakie-congress followers are outside, so does this mean they&#8217;ve escaped Dema? Are they now Banditos (whence the Yellow-background-color)?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard about Banditos or te relevance of the color Yellow, we&#8217;ll cover that too.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another &#8216;East is up&#8217;-side to the Beauvallon-story. For this we have to recall some of the history of the spiritual father of the B-gang, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Denis_Bourbaki">General Charles-Denis Bourbaki</a>.</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.francebleu.fr/s3/cruiser-production/2023/01/26cc0fd8-f720-492e-b0a3-338b51318d22/1200x680_gettyimages-1365628605.jpg" width=60%><br />
</center></p>
<p>In the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, he was given the command of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm%C3%A9e_de_l%27Est">&#8216;armee de l&#8217;Est</a> (yes, the &#8216;East&#8217;-army!), a ramshackle of ill-trained men.</p>
<p>After some initial successes they suffered defeat in the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataille_d%27H%C3%A9ricourt_(1871)">battle of Lizaine</a> and were forced to escape to Switzerland (Yes: East!) where they were disarmed, and treated for their injuries (this was one of the first cases of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement">International Red Cross</a>, and is remembered in the <a href="https://www.bourbakipanorama.ch/">Bourbaki Panorama in Luzern</a>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://holzerkobler.com/sites/default/files/styles/hka__fullscreen/public/554_foto_radekbrunecky_mg_5278es-srgb.jpg?itok=fk1L8zMn" width=100% ></p>
<p>For clique-people: Red cross &#038; Red architecture of the Boubaki-panorama = color of the Bishops.</p>
<p>Anyway, the important fact is that General Bourbaki had to escape to the East.</p>
<p>During the Bourbaki-congress in Beauvallon in 1938 a similar situation occurred. From Andre Weil&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Mathematician-Andre-Weil/dp/3764326506">The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician</a> (page 123-124):</p>
<blockquote><p>
In 1938, Bourbaki held a congress in Dieulefit, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Chabauty">Chabauty</a>, who had joined the ranks of the Master&#8217;s collaborators, had familie ties. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lie_Cartan">Elie Cartan</a> graciously joined us and took part in some of our discussions.</p>
<p>This was precisely the time of the Munich conference. There were sinister forebodings in the air. We devoured the newspapers and huddled over the radio: this was one Bourbaki congress where hardly any real work was accomplished.</p>
<p>By the time I had resolved that, if war broke out, I would refuse to serve. In the middle of the congress, after confiding in Delsarte, I thought up some pretext or other and left for Switzerland.</p>
<p>But the immediate threat of war soon seemed to have dissipated, so I returned after two days.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there&#8217;s a remarkable analogy between General Bourbaki&#8217;s escape to the East in 1871, and Andre and Simone Weil&#8217;s flight to the East at the time of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement">Munich agreement</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the &#8216;East is up&#8217; mantra is not the only reason why Tyler Joseph used these two Bourbaki-related photos in his narrative, but it illustrates that none of these choices is arbitrary.</p>
<p>I think Tyler knows a lot about Bourbaki. His knowledge about them goes certainly deeper than that of the average clique-member (who state that Bourbaki was a group of mathematicians trying to prove God&#8217;s existence, or that there where exactly nine Bourbaki founders, corresponding to the nine Bishops of Dema).</p>
<p>But then, TØP never corrects erroneous clique-statements, every fan-theory is correct to them. In fact, they see the interactions with their fanbase as a collective work in storytelling: they pose a riddle, the clique proposes various possible solutions, and afterwards they may use one of these proposals in their further work.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interview making clear that Tyler knows a lot more about Bourbaki than most people (1.50 till 4.40)</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IsJkXMMAssI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>
Interviewer: &#8220;How far are you into a Wikipedia wormhole when you come across this? (the Bourbaki group)&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;No, no THEY named their group after Nicolas Bourbaki&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;but there is no Nicolas Bourbaki, right?&#8221;<br />
Tyler: They named their group after Blurryface.&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;Even though it was the 1930&#8243;s?&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;So how does it relate?&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;its EVERYTHING and at the same time, has nothing to do with it&#8221;<br />
Interviewer: &#8220;See I&#8217;m no good at math, this is difficult for me.&#8221;<br />
Tyler: &#8220;Math?! *laughs* Math has nothing to do with it&#8230; and yet it has everything to do with it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, in the next couple of posts I&#8217;ll use the little I know about the Bourbaki group trying to make sense of the Trench-era narrative.</p>

<p>&#8220;The word scheme was first used in the 1956 Chevalley Seminar, in which Chevalley was pursuing Zariski&#8217;s ideas.&#8221;</p>
<p>and refers to the <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/SHC_1955-1956__8__A5_0.pdf">lecture by Chevalley &#8216;Les schemas&#8217;</a>, given on December 12th, 1955 at the <a href="https://www.ens.psl.eu/en">ENS</a>-based <a href="http://www.numdam.org/actas/SHC/">&#8216;Seminaire Henri Cartan&#8217;</a> (in fact, that year it was called the Cartan-Chevalley seminar, and the next year Chevalley set up his <a href="http://www.numdam.org/actas/SCC/">own seminar</a> at the ENS).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/items/show/866#?c=0&#038;m=0&#038;s=0&#038;cv=0">issue of La Tribu</a> of the Eckhart-Hall congress is entirely devoted to algebraic geometry, and starts off with a bang:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Caucus did not judge the plan of La Ciotat above all reproaches, and proposed a completely different plan.</p>
<p>I &#8211; Schemes<br />
II &#8211; Theory of multiplicities for schemes<br />
III &#8211; Varieties<br />
IV &#8211; Calculation of cycles<br />
V &#8211; Divisors<br />
VI &#8211; Projective geometry<br />
etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the spring of that year (February 27th &#8211; March 6th, 1955) a Bourbaki congress was held <a href="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/le-guide-bourbaki-la-ciotat-2">&#8216;Chez Patrice&#8217; at La Ciotat</a>, hosting a different group of Bourbaki members (Samuel was the singleton intersection) : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartan">Henri Cartan</a> (then 51), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Dixmier">Jacques Dixmier</a> (then 31), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Koszul">Jean-Louis Koszul</a> (then 34), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> (then 29, and fresh Fields medaillist).</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/files/original/fe0a74e7fa0906cce661b9f2a96895e2.pdf">La Ciotat-Tribu,nr. 35</a> there are also a great number of pages (page 14 &#8211; 25) used to explain a general plan to deal with algebraic geometry. Their summary (page 3-4):</p>
<p>&#8220;Algebraic Geometry : She has a very nice face.</p>
<p>Chap I : Algebraic varieties<br />
Chap II : The rest of Chap. I<br />
Chap III : Divisors<br />
Chap IV : Intersections&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much more to say comparing these two plans, but that&#8217;ll be for another day.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just read the word &#8216;schemes&#8217; for the first (?) time. That unnumbered La Tribu continues on page 3 with &#8220;where one explains what a scheme is&#8221;:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lievenlebruyn.github.io/neverendingbooks/DATA3/tribu36.jpg" width=100%></p>
<p>So, what was their first idea of a scheme?</p>
<p>Well, you had your favourite Dedekind domain $D$, and you considered all rings of finite type over $D$. Sorry, not all rings, just all domains because such a ring $R$ had to have a field of fractions $K$ which was of finite type over $k$ the field of fractions of your Dedekind domain $D$.</p>
<p>They say that Dedekind domains are the algebraic geometrical equivalent of fields. Yeah well, as they only consider $D$-rings the geometric object associated to $D$ is the terminal object, much like a point if $D$ is an algebraically closed field.</p>
<p>But then, what is this geometric object associated to a domain $R$?</p>
<p>In this stage, still under the influence of Weil&#8217;s focus on valuations and their specialisations, they (Chevalley?) take as the geometric object $\mathbf{Spec}(R)$, the set of all &#8216;spots&#8217; (taches), that is, local rings in $K$ which are the localisations of $R$ at prime ideals. So, instead of taking the set of all prime ideals, they prefer to take the set of all stalks of the (coming) structure sheaf.</p>
<p>But then, speaking about sheaves is rather futile as there is no trace of any topology on this set, then. Also, they make a big fuss about not wanting to define a general schema by gluing together these &#8216;affine&#8217; schemes, but then they introduce a notion of &#8216;apparentement&#8217; of spots which basically means the same thing.</p>
<p>It is still very early days, and there&#8217;s a lot more to say on this, but if no further documents come to light, I&#8217;d say that the birthplace of &#8216;schemes&#8217;, that is , the place where the first time there was a documented consensus on the notion, is Eckhart Hall in Chicago.</p>
