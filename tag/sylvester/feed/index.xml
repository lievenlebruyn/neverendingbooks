										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was running a bachelor course on representations of finite groups and a master course on simple (mainly sporadic) groups until Corona closed us down. Perhaps these blog-posts can be useful to some.</p>
<p>A curious fact, with ripple effect on Mathieu sporadic groups, is that the symmetric group $S_6$ has an automorphism $\phi$, different from an automorphism by conjugation.</p>
<p>In the course notes the standard approach was given, based on the $5$-Sylow subgroups of $S_5$.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the idea. Let $S_6$ act by permuting $6$ elements and consider the subgroup $S_5$ fixing say $6$. If such an odd automorphism $\phi$ would exist, then the subgroup $\phi(S_5)$ cannot fix one of the six elements (for then it would be conjugated to $S_5$), so it must act transitively on the six elements.</p>
<p>The alternating group $A_5$ is the rotation symmetry group of the icosahedron</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="https://sites.google.com/site/h2obsession/_/rsrc/1500801405101/twisty-puzzles/images/Icosahedron%20Mono.jpg?width=200"><br />
</center></p>
<p>Any $5$-Sylow subgroup of $A_5$ is the cyclic group $C_5$ generated by a rotation among one of the six body-diagonals of the icosahedron. As $A_5$ is normal in $S_5$, also $S_5$ has six $5$-Sylows.</p>
<p>More lowbrow, such a subgroup is generated by a permutation of the form $(1,2,a,b,c)$, of which there are six. Good old Sylow tells us that these $5$-Sylow subgroups are conjugated, giving a monomorphism<br />
\[<br />
S_5 \rightarrow Sym(\{ 5-Sylows \})\simeq S_6 \]<br />
and its image $H$ is a subgroup of $S_6$ of index $6$ (and isomorphic to $S_5$) which acts transitively on six elements.</p>
<p>Left multiplication gives an action of $S_6$ on the six cosets $S_6/H =\{ \sigma H~:~\sigma \in S_6 \}$, that is a groupmorphism<br />
\[<br />
\phi : S_6 \rightarrow Sym(\{ \sigma H \}) = S_6 \]<br />
which is our odd automorphism (actually it is even, of order two). A calculation shows that $\phi$ sends permutations of cycle shape $2.1^4$ to shape $2^3$, so can&#8217;t be given by conjugation (which preserves cycle shapes).</p>
<p>An alternative approach is given by Noah Snyder in an old post at the <a href="https://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2007/10/28/the-outer-automorphism-of-s_6/">Secret Blogging Seminar</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we like to identify the six points $\{ a,b,c,d,e,f \}$ with the six points $\{ 0,1,2,3,4,\infty \}$ of the projective line $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_5$.</p>
<p>There are $6!$ different ways to do this set-theoretically, but lots of them are the same up to an automorphism of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$, that is an element of $PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ acting via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_transformation">Mobius transformations</a> on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$.</p>
<p>$PGL_2(\mathbb{F}_5)$ acts $3$-transitively on $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$ so we can fix three elements in each class, say $a=0,b=1$ and $f=\infty$, leaving six different ways to label the points of the projective line<br />
\[<br />
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}<br />
&#038; a &#038; b &#038; c &#038; d &#038; e &#038; f \\<br />
\hline<br />
1 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 2 &#038; 3 &#038; 4 &#038; \infty \\<br />
2 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 2 &#038; 4 &#038; 3 &#038; \infty \\<br />
3 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 3 &#038; 2 &#038; 4 &#038; \infty \\<br />
4 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 3 &#038; 4 &#038; 2 &#038; \infty \\<br />
5 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 4 &#038; 2 &#038; 3 &#038; \infty \\<br />
6 &#038; 0 &#038; 1 &#038; 4 &#038; 3 &#038; 2 &#038; \infty<br />
\end{array}<br />
\]<br />
A permutation of the six elements $\{ a,b,c,d,e,f \}$ will result in a permutation of the six classes of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$-labelings giving the odd automorphism<br />
\[<br />
\phi : S_6 = Sym(\{ a,b,c,d,e,f \}) \rightarrow Sym(\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}) = S_6 \]<br />
An example: the involution $(a,b)$ swaps the points $0$ and $1$ in $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$, which can be corrected via the Mobius-automorphism $t \mapsto 1-t$. But this automorphism has an effect on the remaining points<br />
\[<br />
2 \leftrightarrow 4 \qquad 3 \leftrightarrow 3 \qquad \infty \leftrightarrow \infty \]<br />
So the six different $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_5)$ labelings are permuted as<br />
\[<br />
\phi((a,b))=(1,6)(2,5)(3,4) \]<br />
showing (again) that $\phi$ is not a conjugation-automorphism.</p>
<p>Yet another, and in fact the original, approach by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joseph_Sylvester">James Sylvester</a> uses the strange terminology of <em>duads</em>, <em>synthemes</em> and <em>synthematic totals</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>duad</em> is a $2$-element subset of $\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$ (there are $15$ of them).</li>
<li>A <em>syntheme</em> is a partition of $\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$ into three duads (there are $15$ of them).</li>
<li>A <em>(synthematic) total</em> is a partition of the $15$ duads into $5$ synthemes, and they are harder to count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/the-symmetric-group-3/">nice blog-post by Peter Cameron</a> on this, as well as his paper <a href="https://cameroncounts.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/m12.pdf">From $M_{12}$ to $M_{24}$ (after Graham Higman)</a>. As my master-students have to work their own way through this paper I will not spoil their fun in trying to deduce that</p>
<ul>
<li>Two totals have exactly one syntheme in common, so synthemes are &#8216;duads of totals&#8217;.</li>
<li>Three synthemes lying in disjoint pairs of totals must consist of synthemes containing a fixed duad, so duads are &#8216;synthemes of totals&#8217;.</li>
<li>Duads come from disjoint synthemes of totals in this way if and only if they share a point, so points are &#8216;totals of totals&#8217;</li>
</ul>
<p>My hint to the students was &#8220;Google for John Baez+six&#8221;, hoping they&#8217;ll discover Baez&#8217; marvellous post <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/six.html">Some thoughts on the number $6$</a>, and in particular, the image (due to Greg Egan) in that post</p>
<p><center><br />
<img decoding="async" src="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/mathematical/tutte-coxeter_graph_duads_synthemes.png"><br />
</center></p>
<p>which makes everything visually clear.</p>
<p>The duads are the $15$ red vertices, the synthemes the $15$ blue vertices, connected by edges when a duad is contained in a syntheme. One obtains the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutte%E2%80%93Coxeter_graph">Tutte-Coxeter graph</a>.</p>
<p>The $6$ concentric rings around the picture are the $6$ synthematic totals. A band of color appears in one of these rings near some syntheme if that syntheme is part of that synthematic total.</p>
<p>If $\{ t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4,t_5,t_6 \}$ are the six totals, then any permutation $\sigma$ of $\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$ induces a permutation $\phi(\sigma)$ of the totals, giving the odd automorphism<br />
\[<br />
\phi : S_6 = Sym(\{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}) \rightarrow Sym(\{ t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4,t_5,t_6 \}) = S_6 \]</p>
